\section{Problem 7}
\label{part7}
\subsection*{Question}
\begingroup
\begin{verbatim}
Which 5 raters most agreed with each other? Show the raters'
IDs and Pearson's r, sorted by r.
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Here we need Pearson's r value so I used ``recommendations.py'' program to calculate Pearson's r value.
\item I used ``topMatches()'' function and wrote few lines of code so that I get the raters who agreed with each other and the Pearson's r value and duplicates were removed as well.
\item Listing \ref{lst:7} will give the list of rater's ID's and the corresponding Pearson's r value
\item The script is executed as shown below:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
./mostagreed.py 800
\end{lstlisting}
\item The output for the above script is listed in \ref{lst:q7output}. It is difficult to pick top 5 raters who agreed with each other as The Pearson's r value is 1.0 for almost 750 matches. So I displayed all the matches.
