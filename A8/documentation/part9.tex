\section{Problem 9}
\label{part9}
\subsection*{Question}
\begingroup
\begin{verbatim}
What movie was rated highest on average by men over 40? By men
under 40?
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Listing \ref{lst:q9} shows the source for getting the movie that was rated highest on average by given gender , given criteria for age (under and over) and age barrier and number of movies to be listed.
\item I used the same code I used for question \ref{part2} and \ref{part3} and added couple of lines where ever required 
\item To get the movies that were rated highest by men over 40 years , I use the following script:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
 ./highestratingbyage.py 19 "over" 40 "M"
\end{lstlisting}
\item The output for the the movies rated by men over 40 is as below
