\section{Problem 5}
\label{part5}
\subsection*{Question}
\begingroup
\begin{verbatim}
What movie received ratings most like Top Gun? Which movie
received ratings that were least like Top Gun (negative correlation)?
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To get the output for this question we need to consider the Pearson's Correlation Coefficients for each movie. 
\item So I used the necessary functions which are there in the ``recommendations.py'' to get the the movie's name which received ratings most like any other movie. 
\item I used the `loadMovieLens()'  and the 'calculateSimilarItems()' function from ``recommendations.py'' program. But the 'calculateSimilarItems()' function gives a dictionary with movie as a key and values as the list of movies along with their Pearson's score that match with the a particular movie. 
\item We don't need that whole dictionary but we need only one `key:value' pair which had key as the necessary movie name from that dictionary. so I made use of the code which is there in the `calculatSimilarItems()' 
\item The following 3 lines from the listing \ref{lst:q5} will fetch the list of movies along with their Pearson's score for the given movie title. 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
prefs = recommendations1.loadMovieLens('../data')
itemPrefs = recommendations1.transformPrefs(prefs)
results   = recommendations1.topMatches(itemPrefs,moviename,2000)
\end{lstlisting} 

\item This program is executed as follows with 3 arguments form the command line. First arguments should be either `most' or 'least' which defines what kind of list we need. Second argument is the movie name with which we are comparing. Third assignment is the number of movies which we are comparing.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
 ./editedMostAlike.py "most" "Top Gun (1986)" 62
\end{lstlisting}
\item When the above like is executed it produces the following output consisting of Pearson score followed by movie title. 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,breaklines=true]
1.0 Shiloh (1997)
1.0 King of the Hill (1993)
1.0 Bhaji on the Beach (1993)
1.0 Wild America (1997)

1.0 Gabbeh (1996)
1.0 Four Days in September (1997)
1.0 Flower of My Secret, The (Flor de mi secreto, La) (1995)

1.0 8 Seconds (1994)
1.0 Aparajito (1956)
0.995870594886 Scarlet Letter, The (1995)
\end{lstlisting}

\item It sorts them by reverse alphabetical order, except for first 3. This is because the first 3 movies actually have different Pearson's score. 
\item If I print the whole list with out splitting the tuples in the list then the output looks like below
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
(1.0000000000000027, 'Shiloh (1997)')
(1.0000000000000027, 'King of the Hill (1993)')
(1.0000000000000007, 'Bhaji on the Beach (1993)')
(1.0, 'Wild America (1997)')
(1.0, 'Wedding Gift, The (1994)')
\end{lstlisting}
\item It's pretty clear that when I try to print each tuple of the list separately, the python automatically converting it to the nearest integer value. 
\item To get the ratings least like given movie, the script is executed as below 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,breaklines=true]
./editedMostAlike.py "least" "Top Gun (1986)" 35
\end{lstlisting}
\item The output is as follows 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
-1.0 Babysitter, The (1995)
-1.0 Telling Lies in America (1997)
-1.0 Bad Moon (1996)
-1.0 Beat the Devil (1954)
-1.0 Bewegte Mann, Der (1994)
-1.0 Bitter Sugar (Azucar Amargo) (1996)
-1.0 Broken English (1996)
-1.0 Caro Diario (Dear Diary) (1994)
-1.0 Carpool (1996)
-1.0 Carried Away (1996)
-1.0 Everest (1998)
-1.0 Frisk (1995)
-1.0 Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam (1995)
-1.0 Joy Luck Club, The (1993)
-1.0 Lamerica (1994)

-1.0 World of Apu, The (Apur Sansar) (1959)
-1.0 Year of the Horse (1997)
-0.946729262406 Alphaville (1965)
\end{lstlisting}

\item Just like the \emph{most like}, we see the output is in alphabetical order except for the first 2 movies, that's because they have different Pearson's score. 
\item If I print the whole list then the output is as follows 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,breaklines=true]
(-1.0000000000000007, 'Babysitter, The (1995)')
(-1.0000000000000004, 'Telling Lies in America (1997)')
(-1.0, 'Bad Moon (1996)')
\end{lstlisting}
