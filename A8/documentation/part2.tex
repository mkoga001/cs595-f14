\section{Problem 2}
\label{part2}
\subsection*{Question}
\begingroup
\begin{verbatim}
What 5 movies received the most ratings? 
Show the movies and the number of ratings sorted by number of ratings.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For calculating the movies which received most ratings and the movies which had highest average rating I used the same piece of code. 
\item So the code for the question 1 and question 2 is most likely the same except while printing the output. 
\item Listing \ref{lst:q2} contains the source code for calculating the movies that received the most ratings. It runs like :
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
./mostRatings.py 5
\end{lstlisting}
\item The output for code Listing \ref{lst:q2} provided with the number of movies we want to print from highest to lowest is as follows
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
Star Wars (1977) 583
Contact (1997) 509
Fargo (1996) 508
Return of the Jedi (1983) 507
Liar Liar (1997) 485
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}
