\begin{verbatim}
What 5 movies were rated the highest on average by men?
Show the movies and their ratings sorted by ratings.
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I used the same code which I used to compute the movies that were rated highest on average by a given gender. 
\item The code is executed as below 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
 ./ratingGender.py 17 "M"
\end{lstlisting}
\item The output for the Listing \ref{lst:q3} with the above given number and the gender as ``Male'' is as follows
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story (1996) 5.00
Letter From Death Row, A (1998) 5.00

\end{lstlisting}
\item The output shows more than 5 movies rated with a score of 5.0 on average by men and the 17th item is where the average stats to go down, so there are more than 5 movies with the highest average rating among men.
