\section{Problem 2}
\label{part2}
\subsection*{Question}
\begingroup
\begin{verbatim}
Create an ASCII and JPEG dendrogram that clusters (i.e., HAC)
the most similar blogs (see slides 12 & 13).  Include the JPEG in
your report and upload the ascii file to github (it will be too
unwieldy for inclusion in the report).
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The script show in Listing \ref{lst:dendro-code} uses the \emph{Toby Segaran's clusters.py} code in Listing \ref{lst:clusters} and produces the Dendrogram shown in Figure \ref{Dendrogram}

\item The printclust function on line 8 in Listing \ref{lst:dendro-code} prints the dendrogram. The drawdendrogram function on line 11 saves a JPEG of the dendrogram.

\item The ascii file of the dendrogram is uploaded to github, and the file name is \emph{ascii-dendrogram.txt}.

\item Unfortunately, it is difficult to see, but this dendogram shows that the blogs calculated to be most like \emph{F-Measure} are split into two clusters, the blogs in the first cluster are \emph{YOUNGEST INDIE} and \emph{Music Liberation}, the blogs in second cluster are \emph{The Devils Music} and \emph{McCrak's Juke}. 
\item The blog calculated to be most like \emph{Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group} are \emph{Koranteng's Toli} and \emph{words of advance for young people}.
\end{enumerate}
