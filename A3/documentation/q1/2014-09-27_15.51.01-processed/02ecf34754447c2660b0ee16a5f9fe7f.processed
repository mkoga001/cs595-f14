[8]Lessons of Good Sisterhood

   -Don’t hit on your friend’s boyfriends or husbands (duh!)

   -Don’t call your friend’s boyfriend/husband without asking her first

   -If your best male friend is dating, don’t see him alone or have long
   conversations about his relationship. See him with his new girlfriend
   and try to befriend her too. No dinners behind her back.

   -Just because he is your male friend, don’t defend him if he treats his
   girlfriend poorly or lies and cheats on her. Remember it can happen to
   you too..

   -If your girlfriend complains about her boyfriend, listen but don’t
   butt in. If they stay together you will pay the price if you tell her
   to leave him.

   -Never be a married man’s confidante. Tell him to find a therapist.

   -Avoid emotional cheating by being civil but not too close to married
   men at work.

   -If you hear that your girlfriend’s boyfriend or husband is cheating,
   or if he hits on you, tell her. You may lose her friendship but you
   will help her get rid of an asshole.

   -Don’t tell your girlfriend’s boyfriend or husband her secrets or
   anything that can make her uncomfortable.


   The same can be applied to men.

[14]Slut shaming vs Class

   There is a lot of shaming in shaming nowadays. The era of political
   correctedness became “you can’t shame this, you can’t shame that”. Fat
   shaming, gay shaming, slut shaming, etc. I want to discuss slut
   shaming. What men or women do with their bodies and how they lead their
   sexual lives is nobody’s business, really. When women dress sexy, men
   should be able to control themselves and not see that as a sign these
   women are up for grabs (pun intended).

   [15]Image

   However, as the mother of two females, I see with sadness some behavior
   in young women that isn’t very attractive. And it reeks of desperation.
   Looking at Brazil, for example, or American reality TV, I see some
   women who will do anything to embarrass or devalue themselves. And that
   has little to do with how they dress. If there is one thing I think is
   still attractive in people, it is class. Good manners, respect.
   Sometimes women sell themselves short or think that sexuality alone
   will take them places, land them a rich or famous boyfriend or make
   themselves famous. That kind of fame is fleeting. The kind of men they
   will attract is not the desirable kind. Sexy and attractive young women
   are a dime a dozen in this planet, especially with all the body
   enhancements available. A Brazilian starlet (see picture above)
   humiliated herself for Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo,
   planting herself in front of his hotel during the football World Cup in
   Brazil and following him around after saying she had had an affair with
   him. Another Brazilian uses nudity to become a famous piano player.

   There is nothing less attractive than an over made-up woman who opens
   her mouth and talks trash….no education, culture or information.
   Intelligence is sexy, and class is just another name for self-respect.

[20]Are Brazilians happier?

   [21]Brasil “In Brazil. My people. Money or no money. Still happy.”

   This is a comment made by a Brazilian, in broken English, when asked
   what he missed about Brazil. We hear a lot that even poor Brazilians,
   sometimes living in slum-like environment, seem happy. What is the
   reason for that? Brazilians put friends, family and celebrations ahead
   of possesions. True, Brazilians love an iPhone and a flat screen TV or
   even a nice imported car. But there are other things that make them
   happy: football (soccer), churrasco with friends (barbecue), beach
   (free), cold beer (cheap), open channels on TV (free), nature (free).
   This capacity to be joyful and playful even in the face of bad living
   conditions, long lines for healthcare, packed public transportation,
   low minimum wages and high criminality in big cities is inherent to a
   population that doesn’t take life (or work) too seriously.  Here are
   some reasons that may make Brazilians happier than other nationalities:


   1)      Warm engaging personalities, curiosity. Brazilians are usually
   extroverts and like to talk to everyone, even strangers. Brazilians are
   people-people. They like to live in dense population areas because they
   like to be around people. Brazilians are not fond of living too
   isolated.


   2)      Brazilians don’t take religion too seriously. Even if they call
   themselves Catholic, they don’t frequent church with assiduity and
   don’t let religious doctrines run their lives, prejudice and all.


   3)      Brazilians are more open to sexuality. There is less guilt
   about revealing clothes or showing the human body.


   4)       Tighter family ties. It is more common than in developed
   countries for families to live in the same city and see each other
   frequently. There is overall less loneliness.


   5)      Brazilians love romance. People don’t stay single long, or live
   without relationships.


   6)      Brazilians work hard despite their fame of being party people,
   but they do not let work be their everything. Making a lot of money is
   not as important as survival.


   7)      Brazilians take vacations, 20 to 30 days a year. That says a
   lot.


   8)      Brazilians love to celebrate carnaval, soccer games, weddings,
   etc. Social life is important. That is good for mental health.


   Walking in the streets of Rio or any other city in Brazil, you see
   happy people. Are they really happy? Isn’t there depression and
   sadness? Of course. But it is a general impression that people are
   slightly happier than in other places, even if it is just stereotyping.

[26]The reasons for Barbara Walters’ Success

   The Barbara Walters special on her career was a great ride through
   history. Amazing life. I would have loved to have had her life. She is,
   after all, the most fascinating person. I tried to analize the reason
   of her success and it is, in my humble opinion:

   1) She speaks calmly, softly, clearly and intelligently. She never
   loses her cool (despite the nasal voice).

   2) She worked hard, long hours (no wonder she neglected her adopted
   daughter who greatly resents her).

   3) She was not a beauty, but she adopted a classic style and made the
   most of her looks.

   4) She prepared extensively for every interview, getting to know the
   interviewee better than himself/herself.

   5) She famously developed a list of questions that she would spend days
   on. The questions were thought provoking and dug deep into these
   people’s personal lives, making them cry and bringing viewership. The
   order these questions were asked were important for building momentum.

   6) She made her interviewees feel comfortable and open up because she
   demonstrated respect, care, wisdom, class (even if it was fake). She
   became Ms. Respectability.

   7) The woman who had problems in doing anything practical, like cooking
   or driving a car, had a knack for what makes people tick. And knew how
   to kiss asses and network.

   8) She loved what she did, and still does. Even though she is retiring
   from “The View”, she is going to continue being its Executive Producer
   even though she’s 85. When you love what you do, you never want to stop
   doing it. Lucky few love what they do. Yes, I would have loved to have
   her life.

[31]Why dating in your 50’s is better than in your 40’s

   [32]older couple2

   A lot of first marriages break when people reach 40, unfortunately. In
   your late 30’s and early 40’s most people who were married in their
   20’s and early to mid-30’s have children. There are many family
   obligations when your cuhildren are dependent on you. You still
   interact with your ex, and sometimes that is a source of conflict for
   the new boyfriend or girlfriend.

   Merging familes is not a piece of cake. It is much easier when one of
   you do not have children and are willing to become a step-parent
   figure; as long as you don’t demand exclusive attention from your
   partner. If both have children, it is easier to understand the demands
   that parenthood entails. It is easier to arrange your routine around
   the children. However, it can also create a whole slew of problems,
   namely because you are trying to integrate two families with different
   values and habits into one. There is also interference from the other
   parent. No easy task, and I don’t envy couples in that situation.

   When you become single in your 50’s though, a lot of the complications
   with children are generally gone. They may still be in College, but
   they are not dependent on their parents on a daily basis anymore. That
   is a great phase for dating again: you both have time, freedom to
   travel when you wish and lot’s of energy-you are still young. I see the
   greatest harmony in couples that age.

   Finally, the maturity they have achieved make the petty stuff not so
   important; jealousy is not so much an element any longer, a sense of
   calm and understanding prevails, a sense of “we don’t have that many
   decades ahead so let’s make the best of life”, a sense of
   accomplishment, may it be professional or having successfully raised
   your children, an interest in causes and other bigger things than
   worries about money and kids, less need to impress, more personal
   confidence, less attachment to material things and less sexual
   addiction-relationships are more based in common interests and
   companionship than lust. Hopefully, 50 plus folks get to find someone
   who they want to spend their old age with, since being single and
   isolated in your later years is one of the biggest  causes of early
   death.

[42]2013 in review

   The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2013 annual report
   for this blog.

   Here’s an excerpt:

     The Louvre Museum has 8.5 million visitors per year. This blog was
     viewed about 100,000 times in 2013. If it were an exhibit at the
     Louvre Museum, it would take about 4 days for that many people to
     see it.

[48]DINKS

   What are dinks? That is how you call couples who have double incomes,
   no kids. Obviously childless couples that make a choice not to have
   children fit into that category, but I want to discuss the ones who are
   now empty nesters and middle aged. If you happen to have a good
   marriage and your kids are grown, living on their own and financially
   independent, you can have the best of lives.

   When does middle age start and end? Somewhere from 45 to 65.  Some say
   middle age starts at 40, some say at 50. Anyhow, since we are all
   living longer and looking a lot better at 50, I think that age group
   has been pushed forward.

   This phase of your life can be the best in many ways. Your health
   should be good, provided you take care of it. Your finances are usually
   more secure, provided you have not been a victim of the job loss and
   economic upheaval of the 2008 recession former President Bush left us
   with. Having two incomes, sharing a house and not having any financial
   or time obligations with your kids does allow you to travel more,
   invest more, remodel more, enjoy hobbies, eat better, exercise more…the
   list of benefits is long. Not everyone though is lucky to  have a
   companion at this phase of their lives, especially with the high
   divorce rate. And some people do very well on their own, financially
   and emotionally. For people like myself though, for whom having a
   loving relationship rates as a priority, being part of a DINK is just
   the ideal situation to be.

[60]Women in the Middle East

   [61]library An interesting experience to share:  see the meme on the
   left about women in Saudi Arabia not being able to go to a library
   alone? Well, I had the chance of listening to a Muslim woman in a party
   I went to last Friday. This woman said that even though we see Muslim
   women as victims of oppressive men, THEY are the ones who want to
   maintain the status quo, in particular the ones from rich families. The
   system that keeps women from enjoying the freedom that we have here
   also “protects” them in her view. They don’t have to work and they
   sometimes have a beautiful home and everything material they need. They
   like to take care of their husbands because they are the providers.
   They are scared of being homeless, live in poverty or become single
   mothers. So they like their golden cage.

   Which makes me think that women have not yet found power, and never
   will until they have money. Money rules. A woman who can support
   herself and well doesn’t need to subjugate to anyone. There are many
   who have achieved this in the western world, but overall women continue
   to have the simplest positions and the lowest paying jobs. Therefore,
   they turn to men to save them. We all know that a man can be fat, old
   and bald that he can still find a younger woman who is attractive as
   long as she sees him as a good provider. Money has an interesting way
   to create “love”. Obviously, she will move on to a better provider if
   she has the chance.

   It’s a vicious circle. Education is the route to financial
   independence; so it entrepreneurship. Many women feel they can’t
   compete so they lag behind. A man is the only way to feel safe and
   secure, especially when children are involved. That is one of the
   reasons women stay in bad relationships and “fall in love” for men with
   money. In third world countries that is very common. So I was presented
   with this other angle of the “poor Middle Eastern oppressed women”.
   This lady also said the mothers raise their own sons that way, to feel
   more important and more valuable than a woman, and have sisters cater
   to their brothers since a young age.

   I say education is key, but women’s desire to be protected keeps them
   from achieving.

[69]The Crazy Americans

   A myth that is perpetuated by many Brazilians is that there are many
   mentally ill people in America compared to other countries. Mental
   illness is a condition that can affect any human being, anywhere.

   America has a higher number of serial killers, although the crime du
   jour seems to be senseless shootings of as many people as possible.
   Brazilians like to say that in Brazil there are more crimes of passion
   while America has more crimes of hate. In reality, there is a lot more
   crime per capta in Brazil, fueled by money and goods (cell phones,
   watches, cars..).

   When it comes to the urban myth that Americans are crazier than other
   nationalities -which can encompass from slightly nerdy to violently
   murderous-here are some possibilities:

   1) The nuclear family is less prevalent in America. Many single
   parents, higher divorce rates, more lonely seniors, more never-married
   folks.

   2) The decentralized cities, the far-out suburbs, higher dependency on
   individual cars instead of walking and public transportation; less
   human contact overall.

   3) Winter.  Long months of short days, grey skies, uninviting cold
   temperatures that make people cocoon.  It is well known that people get
   more depressed in the winter and rainy days.

   4) The Protestant work ethic. More work, less play. Long hours, 3 jobs,
   long commutes. Less time for family, friends and community.

   5) A more materialistic society. Acquiring goods only promotes
   temporary happiness. There are many poor folks in developing countries
   that claim to be very happy with very little.

   6) The gun culture. The “cowboy and war movie” culture.  The
   glorification of violence instead of diplomacy and negotiation.

   7) Lifestyle. More processed foods, less fresh fruit and vegetables.
   Less walking and biking compared to other countries. Low nutrition
   diets and lack of exercise do not promote mental health.

   8) Extreme individuality. The idea that everyone can “pull themselves
   through their bootstraps” makes people not look for help and suffer
   alone. Selfishness in intimate relationships that makes people never
   commit because they are waiting for the bigger better deal.

   9) The cost of therapy. Mental health was not included in many health
   plans. Now, under the ACA, it will be. Nevertheless, most people cannot
   pay their share of the cost. Free services are few and sometimes not
   quality based, and people do not know where to find it. Clergy do not
   have the qualifications to help mentally ill people and sometimes only
   make it worse with religious prejudice.

   Here are some staggering statistics about mental health in the US vs
   the rest of the world (from 2004):

[82]Can Starbucks fight against the cafezinho?

   [83]Coffee Cup I bet Starbucks marketing directors had several meetings
   to discuss the Latin American strategy. After all, their expansion plan
   in the land of good coffee might not be as clearly as successful as
   their American venture. America was the land of bad coffee. Yes, anyone
   who remembers the 70’s and 80’s in the US probably knows how terrible
   coffee was: a brown semi hot tasteless concoction which resembled tea.
   In contrast, Brazil is the country of the famous “cafezinho”, an
   espresso-like small cup of very strong coffee, preferably black, 2
   teaspoons of sugar.

   Starbucks pioneered good coffee grains from exotic tropical countries
   into America. The coffee was hot, black and fragrant. Lattes became
   popular. Americans were hooked. Suddenly no one wanted Folgers anymore,
   no one wanted weak coffee anymore. It became a habit and an addiction.
   People had no idea how to live without a strong dose of caffeine.
   Different flavors, milk, soy, almond milk, syrups, coffee from
   different countries, a cozy place to enjoy a book or work in the
   laptop.

   Brazilians are not used to drinking coffee in paper cups. Brazilians
   are used to small china cups. You can hardly find “creamer” in any
   Brazilian supermarket. When Brazilians are not drinking black coffee,
   they drink “cafe com leite” (which is half coffee, half milk), usually
   in the morning.

   So what are the chances that Starbucks will be a great success all over
   Brazil? Good. Brazillians love American labels. Starbucks gives status.
   Starbucks is a cool coffee shop. However, changing the traditional way
   of drinking coffee will not happen overnight, nor will it happen in
   large scale. Price is a consideration. Brazilians do not have the
   income for Starbucks.  The cafezinho is dirt cheap. I suspect Starbucks
   will be restricted to the higher income urban Brazilians, the mall
   dwellers and foreign tourists. Hopefully, Starbucks won’t suffer the
   fate of “Outback Steakhouse”, which cannot compete with the wonderful
   Brazilian “churrascarias”-Brazilian barbecue/steakhouses.
