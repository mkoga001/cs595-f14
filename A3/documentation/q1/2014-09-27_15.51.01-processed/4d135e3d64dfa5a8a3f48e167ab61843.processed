[18]Open Data: The Panacea to Economic Growth and Good Governance

Reflections on this past weekend’s True Growth Civic Open Data Hackathon

   sponsors I like to think of myself as a pretty creative person. This
   past weekend, however, I got to meet a whole lot of creative people –
   many much more creative than me.  I was privileged to experience
   firsthand what happens when you put a bunch of these insanely creative
   people in the same room for two entire days.  This is exactly what
   happened at the True Growth Civic Hackathon this past weekend.

   Hosted by the University of New Brunswick’s Maker Space, this civic
   hackathon was incredibly timely considering the perfect storm that is
   now underway. With the current trend for global urbanization, leaders
   need to find innovative solutions to make their infrastructures work in
   ways that they were not originally designed for. The convergence of
   technology and the vast amounts of data now available translates to an
   infinite number of innovative possibilities. Today’s cities have access
   to inexpensive technologies capable of capturing and storing huge
   amounts of data. This data can be sensor data taken from wireless
   traffic cameras, infrastructure monitoring of buildings and bridges,
   mobile health and fitness, and people tracking to name a few.
   Government organizations also have access to many sources of data
   ranging from property tax assessments, geographic mapping, and location
   based service information. It has been recognized that sharing such
   data can lead to things like smarter transport, lower energy
   consumption and increased efficiencies and productivity.

   Over the course of the sunniest weekend that I can remember, this
   civic-minded event focused on ‘people solving problems for people’
   using open data. That is, data that organizations make available to the
   public without restriction on usage or distribution. Making such data
   open has the ability to transform a city by increasing transparency of
   governance and enabling outside expert collaboration. The reality is,
   most government agencies do not have the resources to create innovative
   solutions, nor do they typically enjoy a culture that allows for
   failure – a prerequisite of innovation. Allowing citizens to apply
   their specialized skills and localized knowledge from an outside
   perspective is a powerful model that benefits from experimentation.

   The group of 20+ civic hackers present was complimented with people
   traveling from other cities, and even other provinces to compete.
   Imagine, people care enough about making a difference that they are
   willing to invest in traveling to another province to help solve
   problems. Good food, great conversation, and new friends made sitting
   inside during this first weekend of summer awesome.

   At the end of the weekend, there were 3 amazing products completed.
   These ranged from a portal to all pertinent information on a given
   address (see [22]civic311.com), an interactive virtual city tour, and a
   service to find the location of the most desirable parking spots in the
   city.  All of these were built using open data, which, as we all
   quickly found out, is scarce.

   This event should serve as proof of the value of open data. Despite how
   open the government claims to be, we still have a long way to go.  For
   example, we may have ‘access’ to property tax information, but it is
   not ‘open access’.  Open means unrestricted.  Open means sites like
   [23]propertize.ca would flourish – the very site that property
   assessors are rumoured to use themselves because it is better than
   their own site.  Need another example?  Try to obtain your city’s
   geocoded civic addresses, something you can create yourself if you know
   how, just to see the restrictions placed on it and anything you build
   on top of it.

   The true smart city empowers its citizens from the bottom up to create
   a living lab. While there are glimmers of brilliance being shown in the
   innovative work being done across city departments like transportation,
   energy, and public safety. This is just the beginning as the real data
   mining and analytics opportunities arise from opening all data and
   combining these datasets together. Powerful transformative insights
   exist in these combined open datasets, and they are just waiting to be
   unlocked to provide useful patterns, trends and predictive power. Tim
   Berners-Lee tells us of the innovative power that comes from blending
   different data sources together to enable people to do “[25]wonderful
   things in ways we would never have imagined”.

   ‘Government 2.0’ should be in stark contrast to the opaque, “we know
   better” attitudes of current bureaucracies and needs to embrace the
   power, innovation, and insights that the crowd will bring to advance
   good governance. Government should not squander the opportunity to
   shine a very bright light on its practices with open data (such as
   pseudo-open policies that attempt short-term gains by monetizing access
   rather than seeking the big time savings that will come from innovation
   by allowing open access by all to all). Every elected government in the
   free world claims they are simply interested in improving on the cost
   effective delivery of their systems and programs; if this is indeed a
   core value, then there should be no hesitation in inviting the
   electorate to scrutinize their performance and provide valuable
   feedback and innovation to achieve improvements in cost and service.

   There are very few options for governments to both reduce spending
   while increasing economic activity, but embracing an open access
   approach just might provide that opportunity. The spoils will go to the
   government who chooses to take a leadership role in fostering
   technology innovation in big data analytics by adopting true
   open-access.
