   Since 1879, The Bowery Mission has served homeless, hungry and poor New
   Yorkers. Meals, shelter, and medical care lead to residential programs
   that offer men and women the opportunity to transform their lives.
   Children get a positive first chance through summer camp, mentoring and
   family support. A vital part of the Lower East Side, The Bowery Mission
   now offers new hope to neighborhoods like Harlem and the South Bronx.
