   The Berggruen Institute is dedicated to the design and implementation
   of new ideas of good governance -- drawing from practices in both East
   and West -- that can be brought to bear on the common challenges of
   globalization in the 21st century.
   We are an independent, non-partisan “think and action tank” that
   engages cutting edge entrepreneurs, global thinkers and political
   leaders from around the world as key participants in our projects.
   The great transition of our time is from American-led globalization 1.0
   to the interdependence of plural identities that characterizes
   globalization 2.0 as the dominance of the West recedes with the rise of
   the rest. A political and cultural awakening, amplified by social
   media, is part and parcel of this shift, and good governance must
   respond by devolving power and involving citizens more meaningfully in
   governing their communities. At the same time, we believe that
   accountable institutions must be created that can competently manage
   the global links of interdependence.

   [101]“The Ukraine Crisis: What’s Next for Europe?”

   We invite you to tune into a [102]livestream of the special event “The
   Ukraine Crisis: What’s Next for Europe?” this Monday at 3:15pm EST.
   Carl Bildt, Foreign Minister of Sweden, and Mario Monti, former Prime
   Minister of Italy, will address the Ukrainian crisis and its
   implications for Europe. The event is part of the 2014 Summit on the
   Future of Europe sponsored by [103]Harvard’s Center for European
   Studies and [104]The WorldPost. The link for the livestream can be
   found [105]here.

   The Ukraine Crisis: What’s Next for Europe?

   “Security is like oxygen--you tend not to notice it until you begin to
   lose it, but once that occurs there is nothing else that you will think
   about.” – Dr. Jospeh Nye, Foreign Affairs, July/August 1995

   The Ukraine crisis has brought to fore the existential threats facing
   Europe. The question of what steps are needed to maintain and enhance
   European security has taken on renewed urgency, both among foreign
   policy experts and in the wider public.

   In this keynote event of the 2014 Summit on the Future of Europe, Carl
   Bildt and Mario Monti will address the most pressing threats facing the
   European continent, and discuss what policy options are open to
   countering them.  Some of the issues that will be explored include,
   should European leaders confront or co-opt Russia? How can Europe
   overcome the danger posed by the continent’s continued reliance on
   Russian gas? In light of America’s isolationist temptations, can
   NATO-members count on the solidarity of the United States in case of
   armed conflict? For that matter, can Central and Eastern European
   nations count on the solidarity of their Western neighbors?

   The event will be broadcast live over the web. A discussion with
   Professor Grzegorz Ekiert (Director of Harvard’s Minda de Gunzburg
   Center for European Studies) and a Q&A session with students will
   follow the keynote address.

   [106]Ballot Initiative Transparency Act Passes California's Senate
   Committee

   We are proud to announce an important legislative milestone for the
   Berggruen Institute and Think Long for California, Inc. in the
   legislature last week.

   The California Senate approved a measure to strengthen the ballot
   initiative process with bipartisan support in both the Senate and the
   Assembly. The Ballot Initiative Transparency Act, SB-1253 authored by
   Senate Leader Darrell Steinberg, will increase public participation
   during the initiative process and provide greater information to voters
   on proposed initiatives. The measure passed the Senate on a 28 to 9
   vote and now heads to the Governor for his consideration.

   About SB-1253:

   In its "[107]Blueprint to Renew California", the Think Long Committee
   (TLC) made a series of recommendations to improve and curb the abuses
   of California's prodigious initiative process (adopted a century ago
   from the Swiss system of popular initiatives, albeit with several
   consequential changes), which is badly in need of reform.

   Over the last year, under the close guidance of former Chief Justice
   Ron George and former Speaker of the House Robert Hertzberg, a
   coalition of over 60 business, labor, tax, civil rights and civic
   reform groups came together to craft a far-reaching initiative reform
   for California.

   Initially designed as an initiative itself, TLC chose instead to pursue
   the reforms through legislation, rather than going directly to the
   voters. The reforms are now in Senate Bill 1253 (the Ballot Measure
   Transparency Act).

   The Ballot Measure Transparency Act looks at several steps to improve
   California's initiative process:
     * Making all campaign funding sources from both proponents and
       opponents transparent;
     * Putting in place a non-partisan review process to vet proposed
       initiatives for unintended consequences or flaws that would lead to
       constitutional challenges;
     * Enabling citizens who lack the resources of special interests
       groups to engage in the initiative process by lengthening the
       petition gathering period;
     * Simplifying ballot language to make it plain instead of legalese.

   The bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown’s desk for approval.

   Note: Think Long for California, Inc. was created as a separate
   501(c)(4) in 2014 to implement the recommendations of the Think Long
   Committee for California, a bipartisan panel which convened in 2011 and
   put forth its [108]Blueprint to Renew California to address the state's
   governance crisis.
   29 July 2014
   [109]Think Long Committee Update

   In 2010 the Berggruen Institute on Governance founded the Think Long
   Committee for California, a high-powered group of eminent citizens with
   broad experience in public affairs, labor, and business.

   The name of the group itself implied its main objective: to introduce a
   depoliticized, non-partisan and long-term agenda as a corrective to the
   partisan rancor and short-term, special interest political culture that
   has come to dominate California political life.

   After deliberating a year in monthly sessions, the group released its
   "[110]Blueprint to Renew California" in 2011 - a bipartisan plan to
   renew California's dysfunctional democracy.

   As the work has transitioned from developing solutions to advocating
   for change the work of the Think Long Committee now falls under a newly
   formed 501(c)(4).
