[3]Introduction to the characters of Que Pobres Tan Ricos

   [4][quepobrestanricos.jpg]
   As many of you know already we have a new novela coming to Univision
   "Que Pobres Tan Ricos" that in the English speaking market is known as
   "The Poor Rich Family". If you were desperately waiting for a comedy
   type novela well here it is and I'm pretty sure you all will like it a
   lot. QPTR is that kind of novela that you can watch with all your
   family and laugh because it has some pretty funny situations. This is
   the story of Que Pobres Tan Ricos: Two different families one poor and
   the other rich will have to live in the same house due to life
   circumstances, this will provoke the funniest events that you would
   never expect.The Premiere is January 6, 2014 10PM/9C on Univision.
   Next, meet all the characters and tell us which one is your favorite
   one:
   Zuria Vega is Maria Guadalupe Menchaca:
   Lupita is a single mom, mother of Emiliano, and daughter of Don Chuy,
   and the oldest sister of Tizoc and Perla. She's beautiful, mature,
   responsible, smart. Due to her economic situation she doesn't have
   everything she would like to have, but she's very optimistic and truly
   believes that if you work hard you will achieve all your dreams.
   Because she's a single mom she is the only one that takes care of his
   son, but she keeps in secret the identity of the father. When Lupita
   meets Miguel Angel they won't fall in love immediately but as time goes
   by they eventually will even though Lupita resists becacause she thinks
   their love is impossible.
   Jaime Camil is Miguel Angel Ruizpalacios:
   Miguel Angel is traditional millionare and successful entrepreneur.
   He's handsome and has a formal relationship with his girlfriend Minerva
   with who he's planning to get married soon. He has two other siblings;
   Leonardo and Frida. He currently lives in London but has to go back to
   Mexico to hear the last will of his grandfather, that says that if any
   of his oldest grandchildren has a kid in legitimate marriage will heir
   all his fortune.
   Mark Tacher is Alejo Ruizpalacios:
   Alejo is Miguel Angel's cousin, and guess what??? he's the biological
   father of Emiliano; Lupita's son. Handsome, ambicious, and selfish.
   He's known as the most eligible bachelor by the highest social circle
   in the city. His ambition is so great that he will accuse Miguel Angel
   of a fraud in which he's innocent so that he can keep all the fortune
   Sylvia Pasquel is Ana Sofia Romagnoli:(probably the best character)
   Miguel Angel, Leonardo, and Frida's mom. She's a lady of the high
   society she apparently cares about charities but in reality she only
   cares about the recognition of others, and believes her family is the
   best just because they're rich, she's very selfish. She loves her dog
   Da Vinci above all her children. Life has a surprise for her and from
   living in a mansion she will have to live in a traditional Mexican
   house.
   Manuel " Flaco" Ibanez is Jesus Menchaca "Don Chuy":
   Don Chuy is Lupita, Perla, and Tizoc's father, Emiliano's grandfather
   he's a retired of the Mexican wrestling, his nickname is " El Hijo de
   Sumatra". He's a very nice person, hard worker, and responsible father,
   friendly and a good neighbor. Years back he bought the house where they
   currently live to Don Aureliano Ruizpalacios but he never received the
   necessary documents that could prove he's the real owner of the land.
   This will cause a lot of trouble because when the rich family comes to
   claim their land so that they can live there is going to be a big
   mess!!!
   Ingrid Martz is Minerva Fontanet:
   She's Miguel Angel's fiancee. She's a beautiful woman, she's a gossip
   girl, and she only cares about $$$, LAZY, and she's just like her mom.
   When Miguel Angel becomes poor she breaks up with him and decides to
   get married to Alejo which she and her mom consider as a second option
   "just in case". Soon she will regret it and will do everything to get
   Miguel Angel's love back.
    I know you all are probably tired by now, but I truly give this novela
   9 out of 10 stars and I recommend you to watch it
   PREMIERE: JANUARY 6  10PM/9C ON UNIVISION

[13]Welcome to Novelas Time!!!

   [14][novelas.jpg.jpg]
   Hey guys!!! Thanks for being here in our website dedicated to you;
   because you are the most important to us and because you will determine
   the success or the failure of this site. Well, let me explain a little
   bit about Novelas Time, this idea started not too long ago probably
   during the summer when I decided I wanted to create a page where I
   could comment about the novelas that we watch every night. So far it's
   been a success because people love these discussions about the opinions
   whether good or bad about the novelas. Novelas Time wants to be that
   honest site that you can trust and have a laugh at the same time. What
    we want to do here at www.novelastime.blogspot.com is the following:
   Talk about novelas coming up, novela characters, ratings, your favorite
   actors and actresses, surveys about novela related topics, and much
   more. We would like for you to give us some feedback and comments about
   our website whether those comments are good or bad we will take
   positive criticism because that's how we'll grow to become better.
   Novelas Time is pretty young but we are determined to succeed and
   become your favorite website. Thank YOU!
