[5]Unwarranted Humility

I draw and also have other hobbies too. I'm trying to get better and on more
than a few occasions will post about film/video games/comics etc.
Maybe other stuff but you'll have to tune in to find out! (it won't be
interesting)

   shayvaalski: friendlycloud: agewa: “We went to Kineshma, that’s in
   Ivanovo region, to visit his parents. I went as a heroine and I never
   expected someone to welcome me, a front-line girl, like that. We’ve
   gone through so much, we’ve saved lives, lifes of mothers, wives. And
   then… I heard accusations, I was bad-mouthed. Before that I’ve only
   ever been “dear sister”… We had tea and my husband’s mother took him
   aside and started crying: “Who did you marry? A front-line girl… You
   have two younger sisters. Who’s going to marry them now?” When I think
   back to that moment I feel tears welling up. Imagine: I had a record, I
   loved it a lot. There was a song, it said: you have the right to wear
   the best shoes. That was about a front-line girl. I had it playing, and
   [his?] elder sister came up and broke it apart, saying: you have no
   rights. They destroyed all my photos from the war… We, front-line
   girls, went through so much during hte war… and then we had another
   war. Another terrible war. The men left us, they didn’t cover our
   backs. Not like at the front.” from С.Алексеевич “У войны не женское
   лицо” In Soviet Union women participating in WWII were erased from
   history, remaining as the occasional anecdote of a female sniper or
   simply as medical staff or, at best, radio specialists. The word
   “front-line girl” (frontovichka) became a terrible insult, synonimous
   to “whore”. Hundreds thousand of girls who went to war to protect their
   homeland with their very lives, who came back injured or disabled, with
   medals for valor, had to hide it to protect themselves from public
   scorn.  This has always happened in history: Women do something
   important. Then they get shamed for it (so nobody will talk about it)
   and it gets erased from history. And then certain men will say: “Women
   suck, they’ve never done anything important.” Look into history and
   learn that women have played a far greater role then douches (present
   and past) wanted you to know. Hey Will (and Jack) I got you something.
   So this is important. Let me tell you a story. All the time I spend
   debating about women in combat, I’ve picked up on a trend that disturbs
   me. Supporting or attacking, people are quick to draw on biology,
   psychology, law, but very rarely - almost never - do I hear about the
   history of women in combat, and the evidence their service lends to
   this debate. Hundreds of thousands of women faced combat in WW2, and on
   both sides, and on all fronts, and it is a history that has been almost
   completely erased from contemporary awareness. I have been given
   arguments about how women can not psychologically handle combat. And
   about how women in mixed-gender combat units will automatically disrupt
   group cohesion - the brotherhood, if you will. Both of these assertions
   are erasure. Women have not lived in a protective bubble untouched by
   combat for all of history. Women have been killed, wounded, and
   captured in combat, and tortured after. We are not living a world where
   these are hypothetical situations women have yet to prove they can
   handle. Unfortunately, they have, they can, in the future, they
   probably will, again and again. Soviet women served as partisans,
   snipers, tank drivers, fighter pilots, bombers. And more. Both British
   and American women served in mixed-gender AA units. I could drag you
   through several examples of British women performing exemplarily
   despite being wounded, or seeing their comrades die. The Luftwaffe did
   not discriminate. Between the British and the Americans, it was
   determined that mixed gender units actually performed much better than
   all male units, because of teamwork. Because women are better and
   certain tasks, men are better at certain tasks, and at other tasks they
   are comparably efficient, and in a team, hopefully, in combat, you let
   the best do what they are best at. For the most part, they were proud
   to serve together.  German propaganda never commented on the British AA
   units, but they thoroughly smeared the Soviet fighting woman -
   flitenweiber. People often argue with me that women are a threat to
   group cohesion because men naturally give women preferential treatment.
   Which certainly explains why men are more likely to survive
   shipwrecks. And history shows us that Germans soldiers had no
   chivalrous compunction when it came to shooting captured Soviet women
   who were armed. We’re fed a history of war that almost exclusively
   features white male figures, most of whom fit into this
   destructive constructed myth of the soldier that is somehow both
   chivalrous and charmingly womanizing and who’s sense of brotherhood
   is unshakably dependent on the band being all man. There is no history
   of woman at war, none. I hear a lot about how women have no upper body
   strength, I hear nothing about the Front-Line Female Comrade. THE WORD
   FRONTOVICHKA BECAME A TERRIBLE INSULT - are you fucking kidding me?
   Fuck, that made me cry. At first when I started reading I thought I was
   reading alernate history fiction. I’m ashamed to be ignorant about
   this, and full of rage and much worse bitter shame that this history is
   constantly repressed, suppressed, hidden. WHAT THE FUCK. D: D: D: I
   didn’t know that bit about the AA (Anti-Aircraft) units. And even in
   this article I don’t see a mention of the women of the Israeli Army, or
   women of the resistance if we’re just sticking to WWII.  I didn’t know
   about the Russian soldiers, only the fighter pilots, the night witches,
   and I’ve spent years poking into the corners of history trying to find
   women who will serve as ammunition when men tell me women can’t fight.
   The best explanation I’ve heard of what happened to women after WWII
   comes from “A League of Their Own,” the publicist’s character: “What is
   this—the war is over, Rosie, turn in your rivets?”  Women all over the
   world had to step into the same old ruts. I don’t think it’s any
   mistake at all that Betty Friedan wrote her ground-breaking text for
   the second wave of feminism, THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE, just 10 years after
   WWII, after women had dined on a full plate of the same old, same old.
   And shame on the men who never stood up for the women who worked and
   fought beside them, and saved their lives.

   backs. Not like at the front.” from С.Алексеевич “У войны не женское
   лицо” In Soviet Union women participating in WWII were erased from
   history, remaining as the occasional anecdote of a female sniper or
   simply as medical staff or, at best, radio specialists. The word
   “front-line girl” (frontovichka) became a terrible insult, synonimous
   to “whore”. Hundreds thousand of girls who went to war to protect their
   homeland with their very lives, who came back injured or disabled, with
   medals for valor, had to hide it to protect themselves from public
   scorn.  This has always happened in history: Women do something
   important. Then they get shamed for it (so nobody will talk about it)
   and it gets erased from history. And then certain men will say: “Women
   suck, they’ve never done anything important.” Look into history and
   learn that women have played a far greater role then douches (present
   and past) wanted you to know. Hey Will (and Jack) I got you something.
   So this is important. Let me tell you a story. All the time I spend
   debating about women in combat, I’ve picked up on a trend that disturbs
   me. Supporting or attacking, people are quick to draw on biology,
   psychology, law, but very rarely - almost never - do I hear about the
   history of women in combat, and the evidence their service lends to
   this debate. Hundreds of thousands of women faced combat in WW2, and on
   both sides, and on all fronts, and it is a history that has been almost
   completely erased from contemporary awareness. I have been given
   arguments about how women can not psychologically handle combat. And
   about how women in mixed-gender combat units will automatically disrupt
   group cohesion - the brotherhood, if you will. Both of these assertions
   are erasure. Women have not lived in a protective bubble untouched by
   combat for all of history. Women have been killed, wounded, and
   captured in combat, and tortured after. We are not living a world where
   these are hypothetical situations women have yet to prove they can
   handle. Unfortunately, they have, they can, in the future, they
   probably will, again and again. Soviet women served as partisans,
   snipers, tank drivers, fighter pilots, bombers. And more. Both British
   and American women served in mixed-gender AA units. I could drag you
   through several examples of British women performing exemplarily
   despite being wounded, or seeing their comrades die. The Luftwaffe did
   not discriminate. Between the British and the Americans, it was
   determined that mixed gender units actually performed much better than
   all male units, because of teamwork. Because women are better and
   certain tasks, men are better at certain tasks, and at other tasks they
   are comparably efficient, and in a team, hopefully, in combat, you let
   the best do what they are best at. For the most part, they were proud
   to serve together.  German propaganda never commented on the British AA
   units, but they thoroughly smeared the Soviet fighting woman -
   flitenweiber. People often argue with me that women are a threat to
   group cohesion because men naturally give women preferential treatment.
   Which certainly explains why men are more likely to survive
   shipwrecks. And history shows us that Germans soldiers had no
   chivalrous compunction when it came to shooting captured Soviet women
   who were armed. We’re fed a history of war that almost exclusively
   features white male figures, most of whom fit into this
   destructive constructed myth of the soldier that is somehow both
   chivalrous and charmingly womanizing and who’s sense of brotherhood
   is unshakably dependent on the band being all man. There is no history
   of woman at war, none. I hear a lot about how women have no upper body
   strength, I hear nothing about the Front-Line Female Comrade. THE WORD
   FRONTOVICHKA BECAME A TERRIBLE INSULT - are you fucking kidding me?
   Fuck, that made me cry. At first when I started reading I thought I was
   reading alernate history fiction. I’m ashamed to be ignorant about
   this, and full of rage and much worse bitter shame that this history is
   constantly repressed, suppressed, hidden. WHAT THE FUCK. D: D: D: I
   didn’t know that bit about the AA (Anti-Aircraft) units. And even in
   this article I don’t see a mention of the women of the Israeli Army, or
   women of the resistance if we’re just sticking to WWII.  I didn’t know
   about the Russian soldiers, only the fighter pilots, the night witches,
   and I’ve spent years poking into the corners of history trying to find
   women who will serve as ammunition when men tell me women can’t fight.
   The best explanation I’ve heard of what happened to women after WWII
   comes from “A League of Their Own,” the publicist’s character: “What is
   this—the war is over, Rosie, turn in your rivets?”  Women all over the
   world had to step into the same old ruts. I don’t think it’s any
   mistake at all that Betty Friedan wrote her ground-breaking text for
   the second wave of feminism, THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE, just 10 years after
   WWII, after women had dined on a full plate of the same old, same old.
   And shame on the men who never stood up for the women who worked and
   fought beside them, and saved their lives.

     And then certain men will say: “Women suck, they’ve never done

     Look into history and learn that women have played a far greater
     role then douches (present and past) wanted you to know.

     Hey Will (and Jack) I got you something.

     So this is important. Let me tell you a story.

     All the time I spend debating about women in combat, I’ve picked up
     on a trend that disturbs me. Supporting or attacking, people are
     quick to draw on biology, psychology, law, but very rarely - almost
     never - do I hear about the history of women in combat, and the
     evidence their service lends to this debate.

     Hundreds of thousands of women faced combat in WW2, and on both
     sides, and on all fronts, and it is a history that has been almost
     completely erased from contemporary awareness. I have been given
     arguments about how women can not psychologically handle combat. And
     about how women in mixed-gender combat units will automatically
     disrupt group cohesion - the brotherhood, if you will. Both of these
     assertions are erasure.

     Women have not lived in a protective bubble untouched by combat for
     all of history. Women have been killed, wounded, and captured in
     combat, and tortured after. We are not living a world where these
     are hypothetical situations women have yet to prove they can handle.
     Unfortunately, they have, they can, in the future, they probably
     will, again and again. Soviet women served as partisans, snipers,
     tank drivers, fighter pilots, bombers. And more.

     Both British and American women served in mixed-gender AA units. I
     could drag you through several examples of British women performing
     exemplarily despite being wounded, or seeing their comrades die. The
     Luftwaffe did not discriminate. Between the British and the
     Americans, it was determined that mixed gender units actually
     performed much better than all male units, because of teamwork.
     Because women are better and certain tasks, men are better at
     certain tasks, and at other tasks they are comparably efficient, and
     in a team, hopefully, in combat, you let the best do what they are
     best at. For the most part, they were proud to serve together.

     German propaganda never commented on the British AA units, but they
     thoroughly smeared the Soviet fighting woman - flitenweiber. People
     often argue with me that women are a threat to group cohesion
     because men naturally give women preferential treatment. Which
     certainly explains why [45]men are more likely to survive
     shipwrecks. And history shows us that Germans soldiers had no
     chivalrous compunction when it came to shooting captured Soviet
     women who were armed.

     We’re fed a history of war that almost exclusively features white
     male figures, most of whom fit into this
     destructive constructed myth of the soldier that is somehow both
     chivalrous and charmingly womanizing and who’s sense of brotherhood
     is unshakably dependent on the band being all man. There is no
     history of woman at war, none. I hear a lot about how women have no
     upper body strength, I hear nothing about the Front-Line Female
     Comrade.

     THE WORD FRONTOVICHKA BECAME A TERRIBLE INSULT - are you fucking
     kidding me? Fuck, that made me cry. At first when I started reading
     I thought I was reading alernate history fiction. I’m ashamed to be
     ignorant about this, and full of rage and much worse bitter shame
     that this history is constantly repressed, suppressed, hidden. WHAT
     THE FUCK. D: D: D:

     I didn’t know that bit about the AA (Anti-Aircraft) units.

     And even in this article I don’t see a mention of the women of the
     Israeli Army, or women of the resistance if we’re just sticking to
     WWII.  I didn’t know about the Russian soldiers, only the fighter
     pilots, the night witches, and I’ve spent years poking into the
     corners of history trying to find women who will serve as ammunition
     when men tell me women can’t fight.

     The best explanation I’ve heard of what happened to women after WWII
     comes from “A League of Their Own,” the publicist’s character: “What
     is this—the war is over, Rosie, turn in your rivets?”  Women all
     over the world had to step into the same old ruts.

     I don’t think it’s any mistake at all that Betty Friedan wrote her
     ground-breaking text for the second wave of feminism, THE FEMININE
     MYSTIQUE, just 10 years after WWII, after women had dined on a full
     plate of the same old, same old.

     And shame on the men who never stood up for the women who worked and
     fought beside them, and saved their lives.

   The depiction of female characters and their role in video games has
   been a hotly debated issue in the community as of late, brought on by
   controversial gender analysis documentaries and comments made by
   certain game developers that some took as evidence of a viewpoint that
   the medium has a clear problem with gender equality. While electronic
   entertainment is still perceived on a public level as a boys’ club, and
   has a long way to go in terms of truly reaching  a wider, more diverse
   audience, many seem to miss examples of the underrepresented that don’t
   inhabit the more clearly marketed AAA space.  The following are but a
   few that really exemplify the breadth and depth of the female
   protagonist in games.

//Kat from Gravity Rush

   [74]20121126_gravity_rush

   Kat represents the kind of understated characterization that other
   developers could learn a lot from.  The game places our hero in a
   bizarre, topsy-turvy town of Heksevile, which is the shattered remains
   of a former metropolis floating in a turbulent void after an unknown
   cataclysm. She awakens from a fall into the city with no memories of
   who she is, but quickly befriends a mysterious supernatural cat named
   Dusty which seems to grant her the ability to manipulate gravity. With
   these newfound powers, she sets off to discover who she is, what
   happened to the town, and where her abilities come from, helping people
   along the way.

   The story ultimately treads familiar territory, but it is the
   characterization of Kat as she settles into a new place, meeting new
   people and growing accustomed to her new job as a resident ‘Shifter’
   that really sets her apart from her contemporaries. It is ultimately a
   coming-of-age story very reminiscent of Miyazaki films like Kiki’s
   Delivery Service, and the less fantastical daily routine of her life in
   Hekseville helps flesh out her personality as well as communicate her
   growing maturity.

   In her role as an action hero, she shines even during her freshman
   encounters with the game’s antagonist force, the Nevi. Far too often in
   media women display strength through perseverance (usually through
   severe hardship), rarely are they ever depicted as being anything but
   reactive, leaning towards mere survival over any real ambitions. Kat,
   however, starts off mildly confused due to her lack of understanding as
   to how the world works, but quickly settles into her new life,
   approaching everything with a sense of excitement and curiosity. Her
   control over her environment allows her to never be put in a position
   of powerlessness, and the people look to her as a force of good in
   their community, someone capable of real positivity and change. She is
   never without control over her destiny and ultimately is able to
   triumph over challenges with a sense of confidence and self-worth.

//Shanoa from Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia

   [75]112081-full

   Castlevania has a tradition of pitting members of the famous monster
   slayer clan The Belmonts up against king vampire Dracula time and time
   again.  Order of Ecclesia decides to completely ditch the tradition,
   focusing on an organization formed to fill the gap the Belmont clan
   left.  The leader of the Order, Barlowe, elects main character Shanoa
   to be the vessel for the power meant to slay the vampire menace in case
   it ever returns, which angers her jealous associate Albus.  During her
   induction ceremony, Albus steals the glyphs needed and declares himself
   their rightful heir, and flees, leaving a hurt, and now
   emotionless/amnesiac Shanoa in his wake.  Under the guidance of
   Barlowe, she sets off after Albus hoping to restore her memories and
   emotions.

   While the cliche of amnesiac or stoic hero isn’t exactly a new concept
   in video games, it is interesting to see these tropes used as a way to
   tell a character story about a young girl under the manipulation of a
   male dominated society who through her own brave actions comes to find
   herself as well as take control of her destiny.  She starts off an
   exemplar of the cold, uncaring robot trope, but as she interacts with
   other people on her quest, little cracks of her personality
   breakthrough, which is really touching to see.  By the end of the game,
   her (and by association the player) perception of both herself and the
   world they’re in is changed, and she comes out of it a better and more
   self-assured person.

//Heather Mason from Silent Hill 3

   [76]silent-hill-3-wallpaper-heather-flashlight

   Heather is another interesting deviation from franchise norms as the
   sole female protagonist but also very important to the lore of the
   titular town.  Drawn back to Silent Hill after an unfortunate event,
   she goes up against horrible monsters and bizarre individuals in search
   of answers as well as revenge.

   In a genre known for putting females through gruesome situations with
   little to no hope of salvation, let alone control, Heather responds to
   nightmarish scenarios with not only a significant lack of fear but with
   courage in her convictions. Granted they give a little bit of narrative
   justification for her, at times, detached attitude towards her
   surroundings, but it is admirable all the same to see a heroine deal
   with frightful situations without constantly breaking down.

   Not only does she power through to her goal, every character she meets
   either actively wants to dissuade her from continuing, or is completely
   inept to help her.  The entire game serves to flip horror conventions
   in which women are forced to flee from their inevitable demise,
   shrieking and crying until they eventually develop a modicum of courage
   through trauma to persevere over their assailants.  Heather bypasses
   all that by simply trudging through to her destination and accepting
   what is happening around her.

   — —

   Ultimately, these characters do not undo the history of the supplanting
   of interesting, relatable female heroes by the easier routes of overt
   sexualisation and diminishment, but looking at the way these particular
   games take earnest approaches to developing heroines with depth,
   strength and self-worth gives reason to be hopeful that progress is
   possible.
