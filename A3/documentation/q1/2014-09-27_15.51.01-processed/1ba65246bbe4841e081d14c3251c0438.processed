[11]Sticktoitiveness

   Posted on [12]July 16, 2014 by [13]Edsel Clark

   I like to blog about aspects of my personal life that connect to my
   professional interests, specifically, Education and Leadership.  In
   thinking through some recent personal experiences I realized that this
   past weekend provided me with two clear examples of what my Dad used to
   call stick-to-it-iveness, nowadays we call it perseverance.

   Friday night my family and I watched a movie in the park – Monsters
   University (MU).  As a brief synopsis, Mike Wazowski knew from an early
   age that he wanted to be a professional Scarer working for Monsters
   Inc.  He prepared his whole life to attend MU.  Throughout the movie
   his pursuit is met with obstacles to be overcome and challenges to
   tackle.  The movie ends with a short montage about how Mike and Sulley
   work their way up from the Monster’s Inc mailroom to become
   record-breaking scarers.

   On Saturday my middle daughter decided it was time to learn how to ride
   a bicycle.  Following a few attempts, some improvised fatherly advice,
   and my daughter’s persistence to seeing her goal met – we had success.
   Consequently as a reward we went on a family bike ride to a local
   eatery of her choice in celebration.

   Both of these stories, one fiction and one not, are great examples of
   personal perseverance.

   In education we strive to instill this important quality in our
   students.  In fact the first Common Core Math Practice Standard is
   titled “Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.”  We want
   our students to have both the desire to see a problem or project
   through to the end AND the perseverance to actually make their desire
   for successful completion a reality.

   Have we considered teacher perseverance?

   How do we as educational leaders instill a sense of perseverance in our
   teachers?

   Best practices and research on instructional coaching, mentoring, and
   evaluation all speak to helping our teachers become risk takers,
   trailblazers, and innovators – essentially, we strive to encourage
   educators to try something new, to continually look for best strategies
   meet the needs of our students.  Many of these attempts are
   unsuccessful…the first time.

   We oftentimes allow this “failed attempt” at something new to result in
   one of two responses: “I knew this wouldn’t work” or “I knew I couldn’t
   do it.”  Both of these reactions typically lead to the same result –
   “I’ll just go back to the way I’ve always done it.”  This is where we
   often fail our colleagues and our kids.

   I’m certain that’s not how Mike Wazowski or my Sadie would respond –
   they would persevere!

   As we think about starting off the new school year next month, let’s
   commit to improving one or two aspects of the service we provide our
   students and our teachers – and stick to it!  We know that it may not
   go well the first time; we know that perseverance is only born out of
   difficulties. That reality should be comforting and may even calm our
   fears of failure.  (As an added benefit – our perseverance can serve
   as a model for our kids!)

   On a final note…

   [14]steve-jobs-perseverance-quotes-e1367773016594

   In thinking about this blog post, it struck me that Monster’s
   University was created by Pixar Animation Studios.  I had recently read
   a brief story of the creation of Pixar.  Turns out it was started in
   part by Steve Jobs who, in 1986, had been recently fired from Apple…a
   company that he created.

   Now that’s sticktoitiveness.

   We could really make a difference for our kids if exhibited that level
   of perseverance in our schools.
