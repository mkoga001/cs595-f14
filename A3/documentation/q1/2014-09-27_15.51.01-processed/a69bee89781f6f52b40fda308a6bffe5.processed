Five alternative ways that Thom Yorke could have released his new album

The BriefYour world right now

   Narendra Modi spoke at the UN. India’s prime minister, in his first
   official visit to the US, [12]addressed the United Nations General
   Assembly. Modi announced that India is [13]prepared for serious talks
   with Pakistan. His [14]insanely-busy trip includes a rockstar-esque
   sold-out appearance at Madison Square Garden tomorrow.

   Catalonia gets closer to its own referendum. The president of the
   separatist-minded region of Spain [15]has signed a decree calling for a
   vote on independence, possibly on Nov. 9. The national government in
   Madrid calls any attempt at a [16]Scottish-style referendum illegal,
   and is likely to take the dispute over the vote—which Catalonians call
   a “consultation”—to Spain’s Constitutional Court.

   Goldman Sachs bans its bankers from betting on individual
   stocks. Employees used to require approval to make such gambles, but
   now the whole idea of buying and selling individual stocks [17]is out,
   along with investments in activist or event-driven hedge funds,
   according to Bloomberg. It’s a favor, really, as targeted portfolios
   [18]rarely beat the market.

   The UK will join the battle against ISIL. After seven hours of fierce
   debate, the UK parliament voted—[19]524 votes to 43 votes—to engage
   Islamic State forces in Iraq. Bombings could begin as early as Sunday.
   Earlier today, Belgium and Denmark [20]also agreed to join the
   coalition. The former will deploy [21]six F-16 fighter jets. The latter
   will send [22]seven.

   Foreign ownership of Russian media companies is capped at 20%. The
   [23]legislation passed by Russian parliament goes into effect in 2016,
   with compliance phased in through February 2017. (The current ownership
   maximum is 50%.) This could spell the end for Forbes’ Russian edition;
   its editor told the Guardian that the publication’s German publisher
   wouldn’t want to sell to a Russian owner.

   Canada and Europe detail their new friendship. A comprehensive trade
   agreement [24]promises to boost trade between the two partners by
   20%—if the treaty gets finalized. Germany [25]is fretting, however,
   because of a clause that allows corporations to sue nations. It’s
   unclear whether Germany has the legal authority to shoot down the deal.

   The Bond King leaves his castle. Bill Gross is [27]leaving the
   investment firm he founded in 1971, Pacific Investment Management
   Company (Pimco), to join competitor Janus Capital Group. Pimco has
   [28]been under SEC investigation for months about falsifying the
   performance of several funds in a bid to lure investors. Shares in
   Janus [29]rose 43% on the news. Dan Ivascyn will [30]replace Gross at
   Pimco.

   Activist investor wants to see Yahoo buy AOL. Starboard Value has
   [31]purchased a stake in Yahoo—size undisclosed—which it intends to use
   to try to force the company to acquire AOL. Starboard says there are
   potentially $1 billion in synergies the two can share between
   their businesses. Yahoo’s stock is up [32]over 4% on the news; AOL is
   up almost [33]3%.

   No more cheese for Dear Leader. Kim Jong-un is [34]apparently suffering
   from gout brought on by a fondness for cheese, smoking, and whisky.
   North Korea has admitted its leader suffers from an “uncomfortable
   physical condition” but said no more. A source told [35]South Korea’s
   news agency that Kim also has “hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity,
   diabetes and high blood pressure.”
