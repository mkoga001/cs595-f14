   everything you need to know to get started in astronomy and a little

[14]Introducing the Universe

   When you look at the night sky, all you can see are stars, right?
   Wrong. There’s a wealth of other objects in the Universe to see.
   Understanding their nature will enhance your enjoyment of astronomy. In
   this section you will find descriptions of the objects and processes
   taking place in the Universe.
