[39]10 Reasons Why Men Leave Their Marriages

   By: [40]Reona Saito On: 1:02 AM



     Share The Gag





     [41][engager-procedure-divorce.jpg]
   [42]Divorced men on Reddit shared the moment they realized their
   relationship didn't stand a chance. See some of the most interesting
   responses below.
   1. When he got tired of her outbursts.
   "I had a car accident. [43]Lost my job. I was still depressed about
   family member passing away. My wife decides she really wants a gold
   watch that costs $999. I tell her I can't afford to spend money on
   something like that in our current situation. She shuts herself in the
   bathroom to cry. That was the first time I didn't react to that
   tactics. She comes out few hours later and asks me outright if I want a
   divorce. That wasn't even on my mind until that point, but that was the
   moment I knew."
   2. When the trust was gone.
   "It was when I caught myself [44]photographing street signs on my
   25-minute journey home from work so that there would be a timestamp of
   the entire route to disprove constant accusations that I was cheating
   on her... After that, I just left."
   3. When his wife became a glorified roommate.
   "The last year together we felt more like [45]roommates than lovers.
   She stopped being interested in spending time with me, we stopped
   showering together and began sleeping at opposite times. She was
   generally unhappy all of the time. I really wanted to salvage the
   marriage, but I knew it was over when she finally told me that she just
   didn't love me."
   4. When the math didn't add up.
   "Came home from a [46]seven-month deployment overseas to find a
   five-month pregnant wife. I'm no mathematician but I figured that one
   out."
   5. When he was suffering from depression and she laughed it off.
   "I was telling her about how depressed and [47]hopeless I was feeling.
   I described it partially as an existential crisis. She laughed at me.
   She literally laughed in my face regarding my pain. That was the day I
   realized I didn't really matter to her."
   6. When he realized she didn't believe in his dreams.
   "Five years ago, I told her I wanted to get out of the military and
   study [48]to become a doctor. She's a scientist but she acted like it
   was the most ridiculous thing I could ever try to do. Her exact words
   were, 'You can't just decide to be a doctor.' Imagine researching and
   thinking about something for an entire year and then telling your best
   friend your hopes and dreams and they just look at you like you're
   silly ... I started med school four weeks ago. I'm not bitter but she's
   going to be really f*cking surprised if she ever decides to do some
   Google stalking."
   7. When he disagreed with her on how they'd raise their future
   children.
   "When my wife stated that any children we had would be [49]homeschooled
   by her (she never graduated high school) and weren't going to get
   vaccinations. This was non-negotiable. I was young at the time and
   honestly, it never occurred to me until we had that discussion how much
   it meant to me. I (naively) figured it was a given."
   8. When he became indifferent to the cheating.
   "The precise moment was a few months ago when her long and frequent
   infidelities [50]stopped making me furious. The anger switched off and
   I realized, it's finally over, thank God. I can now plan the end of
   this toxic marriage."
   9. When he decided to put his daughter first.
   "My second wife and I got along great, but over time
   the [51]relationship she had with my daughter from a previous marriage
   got worse and worse. I tried not to blame her; she just wasn't ready to
   be a mom to someone else's child. It was hard to accept that, though.
   We tried counseling briefly but she felt counseling was for 'crazy
   people and she [wasn't] crazy.' Eventually, my daughter and I left. I
   hoped she would change her mind and decide to work things out with us,
   but it didn't happen. I had to do what was right for my daughter even
   if it hurt."
   10. When he had the commute from hell and she didn't care.
   "I had to work late one dark winter night, missed my regular
   train, [52]took a loooong busand had to walk home a couple of miles
   from the bus stop in the freezing cold. She couldn't be bothered to
   come pick me up because she didn't want to leave her yoga class early.
   It had been 20 years of bad stuff, but that was the night I decided it
   was over. She realized what she had done later, but it was too late
   then."

[53]World's 25 Weirdest Drinking Customs

     Every country has own drinking customs. No matter how many historical
   monuments you visit while traveling, or works of art you fawn over,
   you'll never understand the people and their culture until you drink
   with them. But, before you clink glasses with your new friends, you
   might want to take a minute and learn about their drinking customs.
   Just as every country's cuisine is different.

   One of Sony's big reveals at CES 2014 was the [59]4K Ultra Short Throw
   Projector, which turns your wall into a 147-inch TV screen.
   This week, Sony showed it off at IFA, a huge consumer tech show in
   Berlin, Germany.
   There we found some good news and some bad news. The good: it will be
   available this month. The bad: It's an ultraluxury product that will
   cost upwards of $50,000 and is only available to people in the New York
   area.

[62]4 Tips To Change Negative Thinking

   By: [63]Reona Saito On: 7:06 PM



     Share The Gag







   [64][290819__receiving-only-positive-energy_p.jpg]
   Right now there's an energy field or aura around you that others can
   feel. Without saying anything you can emit a sense of peace, calm and
   other positive feelings that can inspire, uplift and energize the
   people with whom you come in contact.
   On the other hand, you can repel people by giving off negative vibes
   such as tension, anxiety and anger. People who do so are called energy
   vampires, says Dr. Judith Orloff, psychiatrist and author of a slew of
   books, including [65]Positive Energy: 10 Extraordinary Prescriptions
   for Transforming Fatigue, Stress and Fear into Vibrance, Strength and
   Love. "These are people who can suck you dry and make you tired and
   depressed and worn out and feel like you want to nap," she says.
   By all means do not be that person. If you want to succeed in
   business and life, you should aim to be magnetic, likeable and someone
   others want to be around. In other words, you want to emit positive
   energy. Here's Orloff's advice on how to do it.

1. Change your thoughts.

   If you are thinking negative thoughts, just stop. Intentionally focus
   on the positive things happening in your life. "Let's say you're
   turning into a victim. Like 'Poor me. Everybody's against me. Nobody at
   work appreciates me. I'm never going to get my raise.' You are working
   yourself up in a negative frenzy," she says. 'You have to stop yourself
   and (think) 'No, I'm not going there.'" Think of it this way: Modern
   conveniences alone have elevated your quality of life immeasurably
   compared with the billions of people who have lived and died on this
   planet over the course of history. You have countless things for which
   to be grateful.

2. Improve your mood.

   Listen to good music. Seek out a good laugh. Have sex when you get the
   opportunity. Or, engage in what Orloff calls a "three-minute positive
   energy meditation." It involves shutting the door to distractions,
   relaxing and focusing on a beautiful power image such as a sunset or
   waterfall. "You just take three minutes to shift and visualize
   something very positive," she says.

3. Take care of your body.

   Exercise, for one thing. It gets endorphins - which act like morphine
   in the body--flowing to trigger positive feelings. Eat fruits,
   vegetables and other healthy foods. Avoid sugar and diet soda. Limit
   alcohol and caffeine consumption.

4. Treat others well.

   Don't gossip. Look at how you can serve others, help your coworkers
   and add something positive to your environment. Orloff also suggests
   "surrendering comparisons," which involves ceasing to want what other
   people have. "Rather, focus on what you do have and if you admire
   somebody then learn from them," she says. "Envy and jealousy...create
   negative energy."

[66]5 Simple Steps to Be Happy

   By: [67]Reona Saito On: 9:30 PM



     Share The Gag







   [68][happy-people.jpg]
   “Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” —
   Abraham Lincoln
   Happy people realize happiness is a choice. They are not held hostage
   by their circumstances and they do not seek happiness in people or
   possessions. They understand that when we stop chasing the world’s
   definition of happiness, we begin to see the decision to experience
   happiness has been right in front of us all along. Research in the
   field of [69]positive psychology continues to reinforce this
   understanding.
   But simply knowing that happiness is a choice is not enough. Fully
   experiencing it still requires a conscience decision to do so each
   day. How then might each of us begin to experience this joy? So here
   are 5 simple steps to be happy.

1. Count your blessings. Happy people choose to focus on the positive aspects
of life rather than the negative. They set their minds on specific reasons to
be grateful. They express it when possible. And they quickly discover there
is always, always, something to be grateful for.

2. Smile more often. A smile is a wonderful beautifier. But more than that,
studies indicate that making an emotion-filled face carries influence over
the feelings processed by the brain. Our facial expression can influence our
brain in just the same way our brains influence our face. In other words,
you can actually program yourself to experience happiness by choosing to
smile. Not to mention, all the pretty smiles you’ll receive in return for
flashing yours is also guaranteed to increase your happiness level.

3. Meditate. Find time alone in solitude. As our world increases in speed and
noise, the ability to withdraw becomes even more essential. Studies confirm
the importance and life-giving benefits of meditation. So take time to make
time. And use meditation to search inward, connect spiritually, and improve
your happiness today.

   4. Treat others well. Everyone wants to be treated kindly. But more
   than that, deep down, we also want to treat others with the same
   respect that we would like given to us. Treat everyone you meet with
   kindness, patience, and grace.
   5. Eat a healthy food. We are spiritual, emotional, and mental
   beings. We are also physical bodies. Our lives cannot be wholly
   separated into its parts. As a result, one aspect always influences the
   others. For example, our physical bodies will always have impact over
   our spiritual and emotional well-being. Therefore, caring for our
   physical well-being can have significant benefit for our emotional
   standing. One simple action to choose happiness today is to eat healthy
   foods.

   It's true: [70]Lack of sleep will ruin your life. If you don't get
   enough shuteye, you'll be more likely to be irritable, your judgment
   gets impaired, and your libido suffers, all of which affect your
   overall happiness. Happy people might be no less busy than the rest of
   us, but they squeeze something else out of their lives if necessary.
   They give up television watching, Internet surfing, or simply worrying
   about things they can't affect--and they choose to get at least seven
   or eight hours of sleep every day. [happy-people.jpg]

[71]13 Ways To Be More Confident

   By: [72]Reona Saito On: 8:10 PM



     Share The Gag







   [73][confidence.jpg]
   Are you as confident as you'd like to be? Few people would answer "yes"
   to that question. But, according to Becky Blalock, author and former
   Fortune 500 executive, anyone can learn to be more confident. And it's
   a skill we can teach ourselves.
   Begin by forgetting the notion that confidence, leadership, and public
   speaking are abilities people are born with. In fact, research shows
   that being shy and cautious is the natural human state. "That's how
   people in early times lived to pass on their genes, so it's in our gene
   pool," she says. "You had to be cautious to survive. But the things
   they needed to worry about then are not the things we need to worry
   about today."

1. Put your thoughts in their place.

   The average human has 65,000 thoughts every day, Blalock says, and 85
   to 90 percent of them are negative--things to worry about or fear.
   "They're warnings to yourself," Blalock says, and left over from our
   cave-dwelling past. It makes sense--if we stick our hand in a flame our
   brain wants to make sure we don't ever do that again. But this survival
   mechanism works against us because it causes us to focus on fears
   rather than hopes or dreams.
   The point is to be aware that your brain works this way, and keep that
   negativity in proportion. "What you have to realize is your thoughts
   are just thoughts," Blalock says. They don't necessarily represent
   objective reality.

2. Begin at the end.

   "There are so many people that I've asked, 'What do you want to do?
   What do you want to be?' and they would say, 'I don't know,'" Blalock
   says. "Knowing what you want is the key. Everything else you do should
   be leading you where you want to go."

3. Start with gratitude.

   Begin the day by thinking about some of the things you have to be
   grateful for, Blalock advises. "Most of the 7 billion people in the
   world won't have the opportunities you do," she says. "If you start out
   with that perspective, you'll be in the right frame of mind for the
   rest of the day."

4. Take a daily step outside your comfort zone.

   There's a funny thing about comfort zones. If we step outside them on a
   regular basis, they expand. If we stay within them, they shrink. Avoid
   getting trapped inside a shrinking comfort zone by pushing yourself to
   do things that are outside it.
   We've all had experiences where we've done something that terrified us,
   and then discovered it wasn't so bad. In Blalock's case, she was
   visiting a military base and had gotten to the top of the
   parachute-training tower for a practice jump. "They had me all hooked
   up, and I said, 'I'm sorry, I can't do this, I have a small child at
   home,'" she recalls. "The guy took his foot and pushed me off the
   tower. When I got out there I realized it wasn't that bad."
   We won't always have someone standing by to kick us out of our comfort
   zones, so we have to do it for ourselves. "Just act!" Blalock says.

5. Remember: Dogs don't chase parked cars.

   If you're running into opposition, questions, and doubts, there's
   probably a good reason--you're going somewhere. That doesn't mean you
   should ignore warning signs, but it does mean you should put those
   negatives in perspective. If you don't make changes, and challenge the
   status quo, no one will ever object to anything you do.

6. Get ready to bounce back.

   "It's not failure that destroys our confidence, it's not getting back
   up," Blalock says. "Once we get back up, we've learned what doesn't
   work and we can give it another try." Blalock points out that the
   baseball players with the biggest home run records also have the
   biggest strikeout records. Taking more swings gets you where you want
   to go.

7. Find a mentor.

   Whatever you've set out to do, there are likely others who've done it
   first and can offer you useful advice or at least serve as role models.
   Find those people and learn as much from them as you can.

8. Choose your companions wisely.

   "Your outlook--negative or positive--will be the average of the five
   people you spend the most time with," Blalock says. "So be careful who
   you hang out with. Make sure you're hanging out with people who
   encourage you and lift you up."
   When she quit her C-suite job to write books, she adds, some people
   were aghast and predicted that no one would read them while others were
   quite encouraging. It didn't take her long to figure out that the
   encouraging friends were the ones she should gravitate toward.

9. Do your homework.

   In almost any situation, preparation can help boost your confidence.
   Have to give a speech? Practice it several times, record yourself, and
   listen. Meeting people for the first time? Check them and their
   organizations out on the Web, and check their social media profiles as
   well. "If you're prepared you will be more confident," Blalock says.
   "The Internet makes it so easy."

10. Get plenty of rest and exercise.

   There's ample evidence by now that getting enough sleep, exercise, and
   good nutrition profoundly affects both your mood and your
   effectiveness. "Just moderate exercise three times a week for 20
   minutes does so much for the hippocampus and is more effective than
   anything else for warding off Alzheimer's and depression," Blalock
   says. "Yet it always falls of the list when we're prioritizing. While
   there are many things we can delegate, exercise isn't one of them. If
   there were a way to do that, I would have figured it out by now."

11. Breathe!

   "This one is so simple," Blalock says. "If you breathe heavily, it
   saturates your brain with oxygen and makes you more awake and aware.
   It's very important in a tense situation because it will make you
   realize that you control your body, and not your unconscious mind. If
   you're not practicing breathing, you should be."

12. Be willing to fake it.

   No, you shouldn't pretend to have qualifications or experience that you
   don't. But if you have most of the skills you need and can likely
   figure out the rest, don't hang back. One company did a study to
   discover why fewer of its female employees were getting promotions than
   men. It turned out not to be so much a matter of bias as of confidence:
   If a man had about half the qualifications for a posted job he'd be
   likely to apply for it, while a woman would be likelier to wait till
   she had most or all of them. Don't hold yourself back by assuming you
   need to have vast experience for a job or a piece of business before
   you go after it.

13. Don't forget to ask for help.

   "Don't assume people know what you want," Blalock says. "You have to
   figure out what that is, and then educate them."
   Once people know what you want, and that you want their help, you may
   be surprised at how forthcoming they are. "People are really flattered
   when you ask for advice and support," she says. "If someone says no you
   can always ask someone else. But in my experience, they rarely say no."
   How do you teach yourself to be more confident? Here's Blalock's
   advice: [confidence.jpg]
