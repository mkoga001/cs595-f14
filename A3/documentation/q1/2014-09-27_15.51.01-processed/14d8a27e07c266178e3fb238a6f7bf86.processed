   And when I say Dressed to impress I mean I’ve never seen someone so
   rich dress so poorly. That’s what you get when you’re the greatest
   athlete of all time though, the ultimate pass to dress like a 15 year
   old in public if you feel like it. Comfort over everything, MJ gets it.



   I would LOVE to see how much MJ has riding on this tournament.

   [128]4 Downs

   Gonna put this out there right away. Please spare me the shit that the
   Packers aren’t good. I’m not saying you’re wrong. You may very well be
   right that they aren’t that good, but this is the Bears vs. Packers.
   They don’t like us. We don’t like them. They need a win and so do we.

   1st Down: Can We Return One Past The 20?

   I wish this were a joke but until it get’s addressed I physically
   cannot take it off of first down. Field position is the name of the
   game and these guys are just giving the offense zero help. Green Bay
   has let kicks get taken for thirty yards in both the Seahawks and Lions
   game’s, would it ask too much to do the same? Just get us to the 35,
   maybe? I’ll even take the 31. Just something to trend upwards, please?

   2nd Down: Expose Their Offensive Line

   Through three game’s Rodgers has been hit 19 times with 9 of them being
   sacks. The Packers offense has looked like a shell of itself and a lot
   of blame is being put on the guys up front. I’d say the blame is pretty
   deserved when you see a stat line like that, but you have to remember
   they have played Seattle, New York, and Detroit whom all have a pretty
   stout defense. I think everybody can agree that the defensive line has
   been about a million times better this year than last year, but it
   would be something if it can really come together to pick on this
   offensive line. Let’s hope that Ratliff get’s cleared to play because
   his size will give them a ton of trouble as Wilkerson and Richardson’s
   did.

   3rd Down: Watch Out For The Hungry Lacy

   As you probably know McCarthy called out Lacy pretty hard this week
   saying that he needs to do better. Lacy responded with saying he needs
   to get his pads lower which is probably pretty terrifying for a certain
   guy in our defensive backfield. His stat line is a brutal 34,43, 36
   yards per game in the first three games. The point of this all is that
   Lacy is going to come out HARD this week to prove that he is still the
   back the Packers have been waiting for since Ahman Green left town.
   Let’s also remember that he torched us for 216 and 2 touchdowns last
   year too.

   4th Down: Don’t Let Them Expose Our DB’s

   You already know Rodgers is licking his stupid mustache thinking about
   our DB’s minus TJ(I hope) and Kyle Fuller who he’s probably already
   scared of. As of right now it looks like Mundy and Conte are going to
   be a go but if they get more banged up in the game it’s kind of a lot
   to ask an undrafted rookie out of Baylor to step up against one of the
   best quarterback’s in the league. Another question is what kind of game
   can we expect out of Isiah Frey because it looks like McManis is going
   to be held out another week. Seeing at it was his first game all year,
   Frey looked slow and got beat quite a few times last week. He is going
   to need to play a lot better this week against the Nelson/Cobb/Boykin
   trio if he wants to keep his job.

   Flag On 4th Down: CAN WE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET MATT FORTE GOING?

   ^No other comment’s. That’s it.

   Expect a good one with the Packers feeling like they’ve got a lot to
   prove which is basically to prove that they don’t completely suck. I’m
   a little nervous about this one just because Aaron Rodgers knows how to
   break our hearts better than anybody, but whatever. Bears/Packers Round
   1, let’s go.

   P.S. If Peppers plays well and you hear about a dude who got hit
   walking down the 90 eating a chicken sandwich than it was nice knowin
   ya.

   Bear Down.
