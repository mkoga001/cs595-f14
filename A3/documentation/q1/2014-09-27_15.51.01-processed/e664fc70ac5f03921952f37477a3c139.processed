#9) Tim Howard Saves Peyton

   [14]timpeyton


   I bet Peyton Manning wishes he had the assistance of Tim Howard during
   his most recent Super Bowl performance. Peyton didn’t have such a great
   game, and Tim would have been there to save the day. Maybe next time,
   Manning will plan ahead and bring Tim Howard along with him to have his
   back.

#7) Aaron Rodgers ($18.7M)

Green Bay Packers

   [45]Aaron-Rodgers-1024x703

   Rodgers is arguably one of the best quarterbacks in the league. In
   Super Bowl XLV, he led his team to victory and was name the Super Bowl
   MVP. In that same year, he was also named League MVP. That alone
   qualifies him for that $18.7M salary. Rodgers has the highest career
   passer rating at 104.9; and at 3.62, he has he best touchdown to
   interception ratio. With just over 24,000 passing yards and 188
   touchdowns, he’s well on his way to being inducted into the hall of
   fame.

Fantasy Football Fantasy: Peyton & Eli Manning

   IFRAME: [68]http://www.youtube.com/embed/qMor6dL0LfI?feature=oembed

Watch out, Drake! Peyton and Eli are back!

   Peyton and Eli are back again, with their new hit single! DirecTV does
   it again, by hiring Peyton Manning and Eli Manning to rap on their most
   recent promotion for their Fantasy Football channel. This may be their
   funniest one yet!

   Peyton Manning is a top notch quarterback in the NFL, but is he a top
   notch rapper? Our sources say NO! But that doesn’t mean he isn’t
   entertaining! Peyton isn’t new to the comedy genre, having done several
   comedic commercials and appearances on Saturday Night Live.

Check out their last video on next page!

#3) Philip Rivers

   Philip Rivers is guilty of making some very funny faces. I’m not sure
   if stem from sarcasm, anger, sadness, or a combination of all of them.
   It doesn’t matter what causes the faces, we all just hope he continues
   to make them. That’s the only way you’ll catch me watching a Chargers’
   game!

   Below, you will see some very scary faces. Viewer discretion is
   advised.

Who is the better quarterback?

Andrew Luck vs. Robert Griffin III

   LuckvsRGIII

   Imagine, you have to build an offense around one of these two guys. Who
   do you choose? RGIII had a spectacular rookie season, but Luck has had
   a more consistent career. Both are play makers. Luck has thrown more
   career interceptions, but RGIII is susceptible to injuries.

Richard Sherman vs. Patrick Peterson

   [115]ShermanPeterson

   Imagine, you own an NFL team. You have to choose between Richard
   Sherman and Patrick Peterson. Who do you choose? Stats may not be
   enough to settle this debate, because they both contain a lot of
   intangible skills and characteristics.

   Both players consider themselves the best cornerback in the league, and
   have no problem proclaiming that to the world. They have their
   opinions, but what is yours?

   The never ending debate: Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning. Which
   quarterback is better? Everybody likes one of them more than the other,
   for their own reasons. But how many times have you actually compared
   their statistics and records? No worries, their stats are right here!

[153]Who’s the Best Cornerback?

   [154]July 27, 2014 [155]Ccjones2 [156]Leave a comment

Patrick Peterson?

   [157]Peterson

Arizona Cardinals
#21
6’1″, 219 lbs

   Patrick Peterson claims he’s the best cornerback in the NFL. Is there
   any truth behind his claims?  Peterson was the 5th pick of the 2011
   draft. He had 40 tackles, 2 assists, and 3 interceptions in the 2013
   season. He has a total of 12 interceptions total in his short career.

   Peterson is the ultimate combination of speed, skill and size. WR
   Brandon Marshall said “Patrick is the more athletic corner by far”,
   when asked about Peterson vs Richard Sherman. Peterson is naturally
   more skilled, which may cause him to take more risks on the field.
   Natural skill can also lead to the impression that they do not need to
   do as much studying in the classroom. Marshall also called him “a very
   focused, and sharp guy”.

   Patrick Peterson is a quick twitch type player, who can play man
   coverage, zone coverage and return punts. He can press or play off, and
   is an impact player for sure. Peterson’s versatility sets him apart
   from the rest, with the ability to play wide receiver, and tying the
   NFL records for most punt returns for a TD in one season (4).

#7) You’ve Owned a LeBron Jersey

   [175]LeBron

   If you’ve owned a LeBron James jersey, whether it be from Miami or
   Cleveland, you might be a bandwagoner. It’s awfully suspicious that the
   Miami Heat have one of the largest NBA fan bases, while the Miami
   Dolphins are toward the bottom in NFL popularity. Someone is
   bandwagoning, and they need to be exposed!

   There are some bandwagoners that have purchased a LeBron James
   Cavaliers jersey, and then a LeBron James Heat jersey, and then
   purchased yet ANOTHER LeBron James Cavaliers jersey! Don’t mindlessly
   buy his jersey! Think for yourself, and stop following the crowd of
   LeBron bandwagoners!
