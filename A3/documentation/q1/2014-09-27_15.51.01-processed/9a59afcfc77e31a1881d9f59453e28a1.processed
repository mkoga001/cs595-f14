   CELINA — The Wapakoneta Redskins used a pair of early turnovers to
   establish a lead and keep distance between them and the Celina Bulldogs
   on the scoreboard Friday.

   Wapakoneta remained unbeaten in 2014 with a 34-12 win Friday over the
   Bulldogs in a Western Buckeye League varsity football contest in
   Celina.

   The Redskins have started the season 5-0, with four of those wins
   coming on the road, including Friday night.

[48]Tigers overmatched by Fort Loramie

   FORT LORAMIE — It’s hard to field a team with just 25 players on a
   roster, it’s even harder when injuries hit especially to your most
   important positions on the team. An undermanned team, combined with
   injuries and shoddy play can all accumulate to a bad season.

   This is the case for the Waynesfield-Goshen varsity football as the
   Tigers’ season is falling apart after falling to Fort Loramie Redskins,
   49-6, Friday night in a Northwest Central Conference matchup.

   The Redskins notched a 2-0 Western Buckeye League win over the
   previously unbeaten Ottawa-Glandorf Titans in a matchup of two
   state-ranked teams Tuesday at Ryan Field.

   Wapakoneta (10-0-0), despite being one game behind in the league
   schedule due to a postponement, took a narrow lead in the WBL standings
   after its win Tuesday.

   The Wapakoneta Redskins were sound in all phases of Friday’s game, as
   they rolled to a 38-6 win over the Bath Wildcats in their home opener,
   a Western Buckeye League varsity football contest at Harmon Field in
   Wapakoneta.

   The Redskins’ starting defense held Bath’s starters scoreless, the
   offense had zero turnovers and finished scoring drives, and a couple
   special teams plays stood out, as state-ranked Wapakoneta cruised to
   its fourth straight win to begin the season.
