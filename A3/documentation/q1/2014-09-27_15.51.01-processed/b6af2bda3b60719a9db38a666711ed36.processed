   Anchors & Reporters

   Isha Sesay

   Isha Sesay is an anchor and correspondent for CNN International. She is
   based at the networks global headquarters in Atlanta.

   Sesay anchors CNN NewsCenter, a half-hour, weekday news program on
   CNNI that takes viewers through the days big stories of global
   importance. She also hosts BackStory, the weekly program that goes
   behind the scenes of CNNs global newsgathering operation, and often
   files reports for African Voices.

   A seasoned journalist, Sesay has covered numerous breaking news and
   world news events. Last year she reported on the death of former South
   African President Nelson Mandela from both Johannesburg and Pretoria,
   South Africa. In 2012 she led CNNIs coverage of the United Nations
   General Assembly from New York, securing interviews with NATO Secretary
   General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and Organization of Islamic Cooperation
   Secretary-General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu. Having covered the 2008
   Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Denver, Colorado, she traveled
   to Charlotte, North Carolina to report from the 2012 DNC as part of
   CNNIs coverage of the U.S. presidential race.

   In 2011, she played an integral role in CNN/U.S. and CNNIs joint
   coverage of major global news events including the protests in Egypt,
   Japans nuclear reactor crisis, the fall of Tripoli, the trial of
   Amanda Knox and the royal wedding live from London.

   In 2010, Sesay covered the World Cup from Johannesburg, South Africa,
   capturing the global impact of the month-long event. Later in the year
   Sesay headed to Nigeria for CNNs iList series. She reported from the
   countrys capital, Abuja, for a special week of coverage and landed an
   exclusive interview with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

   Other major stories include Zimbabwes disputed 2008 election; the
   Russia-Georgia conflict; the assassination of Benazir Bhutto; the
   kidnapping of British toddler Margaret Hill in the Niger Delta; the
   death of Slobodan Milosevic; Liberias historic election of Ellen
   Johnson-Sirleaf; the hospitalization of Ariel Sharon; the foiled
   transatlantic plane bomb plot; the Israeli-Hezbollah war; the arrest of
   John Mark Karr in connection with the death of Jon Benet Ramsey, and
   the Live Earth concert in Johannesburg, South Africa.

   Complementing her role as anchor and correspondent, Sesay reprised her
   role as co-host of the 2012 CNN MultiChoice African Journalist Awards,
   the premier accolade for excellent journalism across the continent. She
   first co-hosted the annual event in 2009 from Durban, South Africa - a
   year that attracted entries from 836 journalists from 38 African
   countries - and has since traveled to Uganda and Zambia to host the
   ceremony.

   As part of her anchoring and reporting duties, Sesay has interviewed a
   number of world leaders including Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga;
   President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal; President Lech Kaczynski of
   Poland; Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf; and President Ernest
   Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone.

   She has also interviewed a host of newsmakers including David Beckham,
   Bill Gates, Bono, Richard Branson, supermodel Alek Wek, Editor-in-Chief
   of Newsweek and the Daily Beast Tina Brown, former Australian Prime
   Minister Kevin Rudd, recording artist Akon, and actors Matt Damon, Hugh
   Jackman and Djimon Hounsou.

   While on assignment in South Africa in 2007, she covered the launch of
   The Elders- an initiative founded by Nelson Mandela to tackle the
   worlds intractable problems. Sesay also travelled to Nigeria to cover
   the countrys historic presidential elections in April 2007. While
   there, she conducted one-on-one interviews with both the outgoing
   president Olusegun Obasanjo, and incoming president, Umaru Musa
   YarAdua.

   Sesay joined CNN in November 2005 from the UK broadcaster ITN, where
   she anchored ITVs Early Morning News program, as well news bulletins
   for the UKs most watched breakfast program GMTV.

   Prior to this, she spent more than three years presenting Good Morning
   Sports Fans for Sky Sports. From 1998-2001, Sesay presented a wide
   range of programs across the BBC networks.

   A Briton of Sierra Leonean parentage, she holds a BA honors English
   degree from Trinity College, Cambridge University.
