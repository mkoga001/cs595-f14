   [10]Happy 2014!
   01/05/14, 01:36:49 pm, Categories: [11]My Lovely Life

   Darlings...

   I realize it's been nearly eight months since my last blog post here on
   Pretty and Poor. A sham! I know. By this time, I've probably lost your
   attention or you've replaced the Pretty and Poor fix you once longed
   for with another blog that's not nearly as racy and entertaining as
   this one. Maybe you're relieved I've finally shut up. If that's the
   case, I apologize in advance. I'm back with some lofty goals for 2014.
   But first, an explanation of where I've been.

   Happy 2014 From Pretty and Poor

   I started this blog in 2008 as an recent college graduate with limited
   funds and unlimited fashion ambitions. I had a job you might expect a
   recent college graduate to have and an income to match--yet my yearning
   for all that's fashionable remained unwavering. Now, nearly six years
   after my foray into blogging, I've transformed quite a bit. I still
   have limited funds and unlimited fashion ambitions, (until I'm royalty,
   this will probably be the case), but my life has definitely done some
   maturing. Don't worry. I don't have kids. I haven't gotten married. And
   I haven't invested in any face-altering plastic surgeries. Here's what
   has changed:

   I got a new job doing marketing for the nation's largest mall. Weird.
   Totally doesn't fit. Horrible idea. Right? (Psych. I love it. It was a
   very wise change for me.)

   I got a dog. This actually happened closer to two years ago now, but in
   the past year I also decided to foster a dog. Me...caring for
   things...crazy. (See all the saucy pictures on [12]Instagram.)

   I lost a couple very important people. Both my grandfathers--who were
   integral parts of my upbringing--passed away during a six-month period
   in 2012. I never expected that to happen in the cadence it did. But
   this series of events made me pull back on some of my
   "extracirriculars" and focus a bit more on family.

   In 2013, a lot of my effort was spent transitioning to a new job and
   assimilating to my new role. By the time I even acknowledged I had a
   blog, my email was full of press releases and broken dreams. I'm
   kidding about the broken dreams, but that sounded so great and
   dramatic. Now, in 2014, I'm determined to get my blog going again. I
   want to give Pretty and Poor a hot new look (MAKEOVER!) that reflects a
   more mature, grown-up Emily, and I hope that you'll stick around to
   witness the transformation, as well as read all the insanely cool stuff
   I share.

   Hats off to a saucy and incredibly sassy new year!
   Emily

   [15]Pretty Proclamation
   05/09/13, 08:06:46 pm, Categories: [16]Pretty Proclamations

   I've featured quotes from [17]What Not To Wear's Clinton Kelly on my
   blog before. And that's because he's hilarious. This week, I broke two
   heels on two different pairs of shoes. I've gone years without breaking
   heels, so two in one week was borderline traumatic. All this tragedy
   has only equated to one thing: shoes on the brain. I need to go shoe
   shopping.

     "Sometimes comfort doesn't matter. When a shoe is freakin' fabulous,
     it may be worth a subsequent day of misery. Soak in Epsom salts and
     take comfort in the fact that you're better than everyone else.”

   ~Clinton Kelly, whose shameless spirit I will be taking to Nordstrom
   with me this weekend. That is all.

   [20]Join Me To Launch the Jaguar F-Type
   04/18/13, 12:27:34 pm, Categories: [21]Fashionable & Fun, [22]My Lovely
   Life, [23]A Bucket Of Diamonds, [24]Minneapolis Shopping

   I am thrilled to be hosting an event in Minneapolis next week at
   [25]Jaguar Land Rover Minneapolis to formally launch the [26]Jaguar
   F-Type! Since the F-Type is such a stylish ride, Jaguar partnered with
   some of the most stylish, women-owned businesses in Minneapolis to
   create a memorable evening in which fashion meets fast cars.

   Jaguar F-Type Launch Invitation

   Here's why you should be there:

   1) I'll be hosting a fashion show featuring unique and trendy looks
   from [27]Motto Boutique in Uptown, styled by the fabulous India Rambo

   2) [28]Sanctuary, a top pick for savvy dining in downtown Minneapolis,
   will provide gourmet snacks and treats

   3) [29]Alexis Bailly Vineyards will be on hand to keep the wine flowing

   And of course, the new Jaguar F-Type will be there to steal the scene
   and cause a little car envy. Come check out this new Jag, plus other
   notable rides like the Victoria Beckham designed Range Rover Evoque.
   There's only five of these Evoques in the U.S. and we've got one right
   here in Minneapolis.

   The whole event goes down on Thursday, April 25 from 5:30 p.m. until
   8:00 p.m. There's no cost to attend, but your RSVP is needed. (C'mon
   people, it's Jaguar...) Email [30]Rolf.Essmann@LutherAuto.com and tell
   him you'll be there. Easy.

   Want to learn more? Read the press release [31]here. And make sure to
   check out all the F-Type goodies, including this video featuring Lana
   Del Rey and the F-Type [32]here.

   [35]Wedges Three Ways
   04/16/13, 09:00:02 pm, Categories: [36]Fashionable & Fun, [37]Shoes

   The best shoes are the shoes you can wear with everything. Right?
   Right. That's why when Famous Footwear approached me about styling
   [38]one pair of Famous Footwear shoes three ways, I was up for the
   challenge.

                          Franco Sarto Casey Wedges

   My strategy? Pick a current pair of [39]Famous Footwear shoes and show
   the shoes in three drastically different situations. I wanted to select
   a pair of shoes that a variety of women could wear––not too high, not
   too funky, not too age-specific and not too expensive. That's why I
   picked the [40]Franco Sarto Casey Wedge. This shoe is safe for feminine
   summer looks that need a little sass. And at under $40, it's a shoe a
   lot of women can afford to wear. Ready for the result? Read on...

   Look 1: Get Dressy
   When I saw these shoes, I immediately thought they'd pair well with a
   floral dress and cardigan. I was right. These are great shoes to throw
   on with your favorite summer floral dress. They have a little height
   without being over-the-top. In this particular style, I've kept the
   delicate floral dress balanced with a heavier belt and bag.

   Franco Sarto Casey Wedges from Famous Footwear

   Look 2: Cropped and Cool
   This look shows how the [41]Franco Sarto Casey Wedges can be worn for a
   casual day at work or a vacation day full of shopping. These shoes pull
   out elements of turquoise jewelry––one of my summer favorites––and make
   it pop. I also love how coral pairs with turquoise. So in this
   combination, that's exactly what I did. I paired turquoise with coral
   and finished it off with crisp white. Think about how these wedges
   might pair with your favorite pair of colorful cropped pants this
   summer.

   Look 3: Flaunt Your Stripes
   While I would wear any of these three looks, this particular look is
   most closely aligned with my personal style aesthetic. I love bold
   colors and patterns that have ladylike flair so I wanted to show these
   wedges in that sort of style scenario. By introducing two new colors I
   was able to achieve balance and order while only carrying the turquoise
   through the outfit in the belt and shoes.

   Franco Sarto Casey Wedges from Famous Footwear

   Viola! [42]Franco Sarto Casey Wedges styled three ways. Sound off and
   let me know which look is your favorite. And big thanks to [43]Famous
   Footwear for presenting me with this awesome challenge.

   [46]One Piece Swimsuits You'll Actually WANT to Wear
   04/09/13, 04:52:04 pm, Categories: [47]The Swimsuit Edition

   We have approached the time of the year when all I can think about is
   how skinny I can get before I have to be seen in a swimsuit.
   Hibernation is a terrible thing. Not only am I feeling a particularly
   bit curvy, I'm pale. This is the time of the year when I feel like a
   bowl of mashed potatoes (hello, white and lumpy).

   My brother recently started working at a store that sells supplements
   for "people who are in to that." Last weekend, I stopped by to stock up
   on fat incinerating drinks that will not only keep me full all day
   every day, but will enhance my mood and perhaps even keep me up at
   night. (Their words, not mine.) I estimate that if I stick to a diet of
   soup, fruit and this deliciously tangy drink, I'll look like Kate Moss
   by June.

   There's really nothing stopping me. Except for an unrealistic schedule
   and a love for donuts.

   And that's why I have a back-up plan. I've already scouted out some of
   my favorite, super stylish one-piece swimsuits for summer 2013. And
   just for the record, a lot of one-piece swimsuits are incredibly chic.
   Here's what I'm feeling.

   I love [48]The Madonna by Maio Swim. It has all the sass of a bikini
   with ample coverage. Perfect for those days when you're still feeling
   bold, but also feeling less confident than normal. The
   figure-flattering piping accentuates all the right curves and shows off
   an hour glass figure. Go totally Hollywood by pairing this with a big
   ol' black sun hat and cat eye shades.

                          The Madonna by Maio Swim

   Red Carter makes some of the most amazing swimwear around. They always
   come up with innovative designs that push boundaries. While the
   [49]Studio 54 swimsuit isn't exactly innovative, it's classic and
   beautifully designed. Nearly any body type could rock this suit with
   confidence, and that's why I love it.

                       Red Carter Studio 54 One Piece

   While horizontal strips could be a big no-no, these vertical strips are
   seriously fab. Normal Kamali finds a way to lengthen the torso and
   accentuate the figure with her [50]Striped Halter Maillot swimsuit.
   What's not to love about this modern design with pin-up inspiration?

                       Norma Kamali Striped One Piece

   As you can probably tell by this point in the post, I tend to gravitate
   toward bold designs in black and white. But, if you're more of a floral
   fan, this feminine [51]Nanette Lepore Waikiki Belted One-Piece takes
   best in show. (Full disclosure, I dislike floral swimsuits because a
   bad floral can severely age oneself in a swimsuit. Florals must be done
   right. Just like this one.)

                      Nanette Lepore Waikiki One Piece

   If you can't tone it, tan it. And if your tan rubs off (because you
   should be fake tanning, ladies) then you can at least wrap yourself up
   in a more conservative one-piece this summer–at least you don't have to
   forgo style or playfulness in these adorable styles.

   [63]Pretty Proclamation
   03/29/13, 09:58:21 am, Categories: [64]Pretty Proclamations

   As women, we sometimes go to great lengths to look good. Some of these
   lengths are more extreme than others. Yesterday's conversation reminded
   me of this notion.

     "I reached an all time low when I used a plastic fork from Wendy's
     to backcomb my hair."

   ~A new friend, who shares my belief that flat, limp hair is never
   really a fashion do. We recently met at an event and shared stories
   about the things we do to look good.

   So, can anybody top this?
