     * [7]HOW TO FIX THE TITANS
       Getting Ebola is probably one of the worst things that could happen
       to a person. I mean, I don’t know that for a fact but it definitely
       sounds like a pain in the ass. There would be a plus side though
       because I’m pretty sure it’s one of those diseases where you can
       miss work for a while and nobody really says shit to you about it.
       Sure, it’s not an ideal vacation but it’s still technically time
       off, so wipe that blood out of your ears or whatever and enjoy
       sleeping all day.
       Being a Titans fan is basically like having Ebola. It’s not an
       ideal team to root for but it’s still technically football and at
       least you don’t have to root for a quarterback who drools on
       himself in line at the grocery store (I’m looking at your ugly ass,
       Andrew Luck).
       I’ve supported this horseshit team for not very long because I’m
       not very old. I have no NFL front office experience. The best one
       of my fantasy teams has ever finished is like fourth place. Here’s
       what needs to happen with the Titans.
       · Bud Adams died already so I don’t have to see that he needs to
       die but the Titans did need him to die right up until he did die.
       RIP you crazy old bastard.
       · Put Jake Locker in the trash can out back and just pray the
       garbage isn’t one of those assholes that goes through and picks out
       the things that aren’t *technically* trash and sets them by the
       trash can for you to deal with. Fuck those guys. WTF am I supposed
       to do with this washing machine I destroyed with a hammer after
       Kevin Dyson came up a yard short? Take the damn thing.
       · Fire anyone involved with the team drafting two players this year
       whose names were linked to sexual assaults in the past five years.
       · Fire anyone involved with the team drafting in the past five
       years.
       · Set fire to LP Field. It is the ham sandwich with old mayonnaise
       of NFL stadiums and it needs to go.
       · Bring back Vince Young. Don’t ask questions. I wasted too damn
       much money on that jersey to only get to use it for a year.
       · Bury Elvis underneath wherever the new field is. It can’t hurt.
       The other option is to sneak in under cover of darkness and destroy
       everything Titans related in the world and pretend they never
       existed. I’m down to help out with this too.

     * [10]NFL Week 1 Betting Preview
       Betting on sports is a lot like eating an entire bag of Cheetos
       because you’re hooked after the first few and before you know it
       you are naked in an alley covered in orange dust. It’s awesome. As
       someone who has made A LOT of money gambling (seriously, I’ve
       already demonstrated that I have the kind of disposable income
       required to eat entire bags of cheese dipped pieces of whatever in
       one sitting), I know the things to look for and I am here to help
       you. Here are my picks for this week’s games:
       Green Bay at Seattle (-6) – it will probably be hard for you to
       find a place that will let you bet on this one at this point, but
       just to show you how good I am at this gambling thing I’ll give you
       my pick anyways. Take the Seahawks to cover here. I would not be
       surprised if this game finishes somewhere in the 36-16 range and
       Marshawn Lynch goes off. The man is made of Skittles and bottle
       rockets just held together by melted steak.
       New Orleans (-3) at Atlanta – thinking about betting against
       Atlanta at home? Well let me just say this: SHAWTY SO CRUNK SHE
       COMIN’ OUT HER CLOTHES / (edited the rest because this is a family
       site). Take the points. Mark my words, if the Ying Yang Twins don’t
       drop a Georgia Dome Remix when the Falcons move to their new
       stadium then the dirty birds might never win another game.
       Minnesota at St. Louis (-3.5) – take Minnesota and the points here.
       Even though they cut him, I think Michael Sam had already probably
       kissed most of the dudes on the Rams so they are all gay now.
       Obviously they will have to forfeit.
       Cleveland at Pittsburgh (-7) – you are ignorant if you think
       Manziel’s excessively rich, oil money family hasn’t hired the
       finest of witches to place hexes all over Brian Hoyer’s body.
       Pittsburgh will cover. Hoyer might die.
       Jacksonville at Philadelphia (-10.5) – let me lay out a scenario
       for you: Eagles are up ten with two minutes to go in the game. Jags
       don’t have any timeouts left and the birds have the ball. They
       could kneel it out, but if there’s one thing I know about Chip
       Kelly it’s that the man loves to sacktap people. Literally and
       symbolically. Four verts. Touchdown. Philly by 17.
       Oakland at New York Jets (-5.5) – I am quickly losing interest in
       week 1.
       Cincinnati at Baltimore (-1.5) – Baltimore just unveiled a statue
       of its most famous murderer that wasn’t on The Wire farting on a
       match so they’ll probably be pretty jacked up for this one.
       Buffalo at Chicago (-7) – bet money Jay Cutler stands up when he
       wipes.
       Washington at Houston (-3) – is there an official spot in the rules
       that says Clowney can’t eat RGIII? Because I think he’s going to at
       least try to.
       Tennessee at Kansas City (-3) – if you know me, you know I like the
       Titans. For that reason I expect this one to be close late and then
       Locker to throw like six picks in the fourth quarter and the Titans
       to lose by about 30.
       New England (-5) at Miami – Richie Incognito isn’t around to fondle
       dudes with broomsticks anymore so I doubt we see the same intensity
       out of this Dolphin group that lead them to go like 4-9 last year.
       Their quarterback is Ryan Tannehill.
       Carolina at Tampa Bay (-2) – sincere question, who gives a shit
       about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers? I know they probably have fans, but
       I couldn’t name one. I know they probably have people that hate
       them, but I couldn’t name one. At least they don’t have MRSA this
       year yet. Panthers will cover.
       San Francisco (-5) at Dallas – I don’t know if the 49ers will win
       or lose but I do know Jim or Jeff or Jerry or Johannes Harbaugh,
       whichever of those cement jawed nerds coaches this team, can eat my
       butt. I hate that family.
       Indianapolis at Denver (-7.5) – fun fact: Denver’s quarterback used
       to play for the Colts! I found that out when I was researching for
       my picks this week. Surprised no one is talking about this. Broncos
       are without Wes Welker because Peyton got annoyed with him refusing
       to shut up in huddles and slipped him an Adderall to chill him out.
       Mistake? Maybe. But he’d do it again. This is Peyton’s huddle and
       you can g right tfo if you have a problem with it.
       New York Giants at Detroit (-6) – my only prediction here is that
       Matthew Stafford will continue to wear his “WIN OR LOSE WE STILL
       BOOZE” cutoff t-shirt under his pads for the 89^th consecutive
       game. Consistency is key for a quarterback.
       San Diego at Arizona (-3) – why are there so many games this week?
       This sucks. I wish football season was over.
       UPSET SPECIAL – Eli Manning will not, as most are predicting, watch
       My Little Pony at halftime instead of listening to Coughlin’s team
       talk. Inside sources tell me Eli is adopting a new strategy of
       “getting Bronied up” before the game instead of halfway through. I
       guess we’ll see how that affects his play.
       So there you have it, folks. Parlay all of those together with a
       college football bet or two, preferably on teams you’ve never
       watched play, and you’ll be a very rich human being on Tuesday. In
       the words of the immortal Rex Ryan, “I’m going to make sweet, sweet
       mouth love to this bag of Jolly Ranchers I found in my closet
       today.”
