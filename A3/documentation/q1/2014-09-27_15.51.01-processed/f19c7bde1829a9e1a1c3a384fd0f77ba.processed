   EyeCon: The Vampire Diaries / The Originals
   COUNTDOWN TO EYECON: TVD 7
   EYECON: THE VAMPIRE DIARIES 7 / ORIGINALS CELEBRITY CONVENTION
   In 2011, EyeCon organized and hosted the first ever North American
   convention based on The Vampire Diaries. We are beyond excited to
   announce our seventh fan convention based on the amazing, ultra popular
   series! As our popularity has grown, so has our convention attendance
   which has allowed us to bring you the biggest and best TVD experience
   imaginable. We will be celebrating both The Vampire Diaries and it's
   extremely popular spin-off, The Originals. To all of our friends and
   family who we love to see, get ready for the best one yet...
   EyeCon Celebrity Interaction
   EyeCon isn't your average, impersonal convention. EyeCon is well known
   for bringing our attendees the absolute most "personal" time with the
   stars. While other conventions actually dictate to their celebrity
   guests that they are not "allowed" to walk around and mingle, we are
   just the opposite. We know that the fans are here to meet them and get
   to know them, the celebrities want to meet the fans as well, so we
   actually encourage them to mingle and get to know their fans on a more
   personal level, which is simply better for everyone. At other
   conventions, you basically just get to see the stars on stage... not at
   EyeCon. Many of our celebrity guests not only attend our parties, but
   participate by wearing costumes, talking and getting to know the
   attendees in informal settings!

   Full 3-Day Weekend of Activities
   We not only introduce you to your favorite celebrity guests, we
   completely immerse you into the Vampire Diaries world. While other
   conventions are a short two days, we are a FULL three day convention
   with games and activities starting early on Friday and lasting til late
   on Sunday. The weekend will feature games, panels, Celebrity Q&As and
   Photo Op Sessions, Celebrity Autograph Sessions, two TVD/Originals
   themed Celebrity Parties, and a Private Meet and Greet Autograph
   Signing for even more "personal" time with the Stars! In the past, the
   celebrity guests in attendance at our parties stayed late and partied
   with the fans, judged our costume contests, and had a blast - they just
   didn't want to leave!
   If you are a fan of The Vampire Diaries and/or The Originals, we
   welcome you enthusiastically and promise a weekend you will never
   forget. We are a group of family and friends and we have worked
   diligently to make your weekend the most fun, the most personal, and
   bring you the most celebrity interaction of any convention. To all of
   our friends and family who we love to see, and all of our new
   attendees, thank you for choosing EyeCon for your fan experience!
   WHY IS ATLANTA THE BEST CHOICE FOR THE EVENT LOCATION?
   Atlanta is without a doubt the best location to hold an event based on
   The Vampire Diaries. The main reason is that the show itself is filmed
   in Covington which is only 30 minutes from Atlanta. Covington IS
   "Mystic Falls" as almost all location shooting is done right outdoors!
   It's not uncommon for fans to be able to watch filming take place and
   catch a glimpse or even a photo with the stars once they've wrapped
   filming for the day! Fans can visit all of the locations used on the
   show like the Lockwood Mansion, Mystic Grill, the Gilbert House and
   many, many more! A second reason is that, since all of the stars live
   in Atlanta during filming season, it is not uncommon for them to make
   unexpected visits to the convention! At our first March show, both
   Candice Accola and Matthew Davis unexpectedly showed up for our
   Saturday Night concert, surprising fans! To be fully immersed in the
   world of The Vampire Diaries, Atlanta is virtually the only city that
   can bring the magic of Mystic Falls alive.

   EYECON CELEBRITY CONVENTIONS
   Founded in 2006, EyeCon is known worldwide as the convention with the
   most celebrity interaction in the most intimate settings. Since it's
   beginnings, it has grown in size and popularity, providing fans with
   unparallelled entertainment. EyeCon has hosted events featuring
   Supernatural, Twilight, True Blood, The Bionic Woman and most recently
   The Vampire Diaries!
   TESTIMONIALS FROM A FEW OF OUR AMAZING ATTENDEES
   "I've been to every EyeCon Tvd convention. I always have had a great
   time. Going to the conventions is like a family reunion. I love how
   personal Kenny and Autumn are along with their staff. They take time to
   get to know their attendees by name and develop friendships with them.
   I've been to other cons even other TVD con's and Eyecon Tvd is by far
   my favorite."
   - Ella Worley
   "Thank you Kenny, Joshua, Jamie, and all the amazing staff once again
   for another fabulous convention! I've attended all of them and they
   keep getting better and better! It's not only a chance to see the
   incredible cast from my fave show, but also have a girls weekend w/ all
   my friends. I can't wait for the next one! Thanks again for all the
   hard work that was put into this to make it so awesome! You guys rock!"
   - Kristi Brown
   "My experience at Eyecon last year... It turned out to be one of the
   best weekends I've had in...well, my entire life. What people don't get
   is that, going to Eyecon isn't just about getting to see the actors and
   actresses that we love and respect so much (although that is definitely
   a major factor). Going to Eyecon isn't even about meeting all the with
   the friends we've bonded with over the internet in person (though that,
   too, is a huge deal). But Eyecon isn't about any of that. Eyecon is
   about coming together, ALL of us, as fans, actors, convention
   volunteers and workers, vendors who already live in the area, all of us
   just coming together for a couple of days to really CELEBRATE this
   wonderful show that has worked its way into our lives and hearts. What
   I think sets Eyecon apart form other conventions is its intimacy; since
   it's usually in Atlanta, you get to be close to where all of the action
   really happens, so many are able to tour the TVD set and do those types
   of things as well while in the area. Overall it was a very humbling
   experience and, while my time there did seem to fly by, it was truly
   worth it. Let's not forget our wonderful HOSTS such as Kenny yourself
   and all those involved to make the convention what it is. None of it
   would be possible without your hospitality."
