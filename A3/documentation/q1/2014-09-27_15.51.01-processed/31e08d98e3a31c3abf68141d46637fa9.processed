[3]The Important Thing

   By Michele Corbat
   The past two months have been a whirlwind of opportunities, challenges,
   reflecting, reading, growing and learning.  In the past two months,
   I...
   ...was hired as the new lead learner of Morrish Elementary,
   ...delivered my first AND second keynote addresses about building a
   culture of learning (with my #COLchat friends - Adam & Rod),
   ...felt helpless as I watched my friends suffering with unimaginable
   pain,
   ...read thought-provoking books like [4]The Carpenter by Jon
   Gordon, [5]Passionate Learners: Giving Our Classrooms Back to Our
   Students by Pernille Ripp, [6]The Collected Writings (so far) of Rick
   Wormeli by Rick Wormeli and [7]Brick House by Danny Hill
   The past two months have taught me lessons that I will carry forward
   and do my best to put into action.  The past two months have been two
   of the most important months of the year for me.  These are some
   lessons I have learned. These are some of the important things about
   the past two months.
   The important thing about leadership is the ability to create more
   leaders.
   It begins with trusting relationships.
   It can influence up, across or down.
   It has common traits like honesty, empathy, and transparency.
   But the important thing about leadership is the ability to create more
   leaders.
   The important thing about facing fear is growing from being pushed out
   of your comfort zone.
   It peels away an old layer of yourself so you can become something
   better.
   It makes you braver to try things you have never tried before.
   It shows you how strong you really are.
   But the important thing about facing fear is growing from being pushed
   out of your comfort zone.
   The important thing about friendship is knowing that you are not alone
   in the world.
   It makes you feel better when all that person has to do is be there
   when you are hurting.
   It reminds us how much people care about us and love us.
   It brings a smile and chuckle when you are alone thinking about a funny
   memory.
   But the important thing about friendship is knowing that you are not
   alone in the world.
   The important thing about passion is it helps us live our purpose.
   It drives us to find answers to our questions and to create.
   It brings hope to students when they are allowed to explore it.
   It thrives in a culture of learning, but is killed in a culture of
   compliance.
   But the important thing about passion is it helps us live our purpose.
   The important thing about language is it has the power to kill or to
   give life.
   It is a free choice you make every day.
   It can shift fixed mindsets to growth mindsets.
   It shows those who you love, serve, and care about that they matter.
   But the important thing about language is it has the power to kill or
   to give life.
   The important thing about reading is it takes us out of our own minds
   and into the minds of others.
   It is the starting step that prepares us to cook a meal, use a new
   gadget, or take a trip.
   It boosts our imaginations and creativity.
   It allows us to gain knowledge and experience from others.
   But the important thing about reading is it takes us out of our own
   minds and into the minds of others.
   These are a few of the lessons I have learned over the past two months.
    These are a few of the important things.

[16]Bye Bye Bystander, Hello Hero

   By Michele Corbat
   [DEL: Sometimes :DEL] scratch that, many times this past school year I
   have been astounded by the way my school community has come together to
   support one another and show kindness.  We've had tragedies that have
   forever changed us, such as the death of  beloved Dieck Elementary
   teacher, Mr. Christopher Carney and the suicide of adored high school
   senior and varsity football quarterback, Brendon Fitch.  Our teachers,
   administrators, students, parents, and the entire community pulled
   together for the families of these individuals (Chris's wife is also a
   teacher at Dieck Elementary where his two children are students and
   Brendon's mom, uncle and aunt are all teachers at Swartz Creek
   Schools where his cousins also attend school).  On Saturday, May 10th,
   students and staff from Swartz Creek Middle School, joined together,
   once again, to show kindness.  Thanks to the work of our SCMS Diversity
   Club, which is lead by teacher, Tony Suchanek,  the first ever "Bye Bye
   Bystander, Hello Hero" event was held on Saturday, May 10.

                           [17][description.PNG]
              Description of the event on our district website

   A Little Background
   On November 4 & 5, 2013, several hundred educators, students and
   community members gathered for the first ever [18]The Hero
   Roundtable at Swartz Creek High School. This is a
   one-of-a-kind multi-disciplinary conference on heroism and was
   organized by [19]Adam Hartley and [20]Matt Langdon.  The opposite of a
   hero is not a villain; it's a bystander. Every community in the world,
   big or small, can use more heroes. Those who attended, learned how to
   stop being bystanders and start becoming heroes.
   I attended the conference with a small group of middle school students
   and a few other teachers.  We were moved by stories shared by Jeremiah
   Anthony, a high school kid from Iowa City, Iowa who created the Twitter
   account [21]Westhighbros to take a stand against bullying.  The account
   tweets sincere compliments to students and staff.  And stories from
   author, [22]Dave Rendall, who told us, "What makes us weak, makes us
   strong and what makes us weird, makes us wonderful."  He encouraged us
   to embrace our uniqueness by flaunting our weakness.  We also heard
   from a 15 year old boy from Michigan, [23]Ethan King, who started a
   non-profit charity to donate soccer balls to under-privileged children
   around the world when he was only 12!  Ethan told us, "It doesn't
   matter how old or how young you are, you can make a difference."
   After this inspiring event, the students, teachers and I met a few
   times to plan how we could begin taking action in our school.  Many
   ideas were shared and initiatives were beginning to happen in small
   ways in our school. Paper buckets were posted on all staff members'
   doors or work spaces. Announcements were made to fill the buckets with
   post-it notes with compliments or uplifting messages.  Lockers were
   decorated with uplifting notes and compliments as well.  Students and
   staff were encouraged to take the Ten Day Challenge.

                            The Ten Day Challenge

   Thanks to my colleague, Tony Suchanek, the momentum continued.  Tony is
   a 6th grade teacher in our school who started and leads our Diversity
   Club.  He took the ideas from The Hero Roundtable Conference to this
   club and we had a movement!
   Fast Forward To This Weekend
   The Diversity Club organized an event to make an even bigger impact.
   They organized the first annual, "Bye Bye Bystander, Hello Hero
   Celebration".  I attended this celebration on Saturday.  As
   participants arrived, they signed in to the guest book and noted the
   time.  When we left, we signed out and noted the time. These logs will
   be used to determine how many people were involved as well as how many
   total minutes people stood up against bullying.  There were
   problem-solving games like untangling a human knot and uplifting games
   like a compliment web.  Students sang and danced.  Three of our 8th
   grade students rocked the house as their band played rock classics from
   the 80's.
   Most moving for all though, were the stories shared during open mic
   time.  Some shared stories about feeling worthless because of how
   others had picked on them to the point that they wondered if life was
   worth living.  Others shared stories of knowing you are different and
   celebrating those differences anyways.  A parent took the mic and
   explained to students that our attitude is not a feeling, rather a
   choice.  He told us that we can choose kindness.  In between stories,
   videos were shown about people who took action as heroes like the story
   of the Olivet Middle School Football team who planned to make a
   classmates day, to make his week, to make him happy.
   [DEL: :DEL]

   Inspirational messages were also shared from across the world from
   people like [26]Matt Langdon, [27]Jeremiah Anthony and [28]Ethan King.
   They encouraged the students to keep standing and doing the right
   thing.
   Now What?
   I wasn't the only one impacted by this event.  A ripple of kindness is
   spreading.  I know this because three students have started an
   Instagram account that they call SCMS_Hero.
   [29][description+of+instagram.PNG]
   [30][instagram+post.PNG]

   [31][comment+on+instagram.PNG]

   This is one example of how the event made an impact on those who
   attended.  I wonder how many other people, both students and
   adults, left the event thinking, "I will not stand by, I will STAND UP
   when I see someone in need."   I am excited to see what the future
   holds for my community because I know that this is not the end.  It is
   the beginning.  The beginning of a movement where people look out for
   each other.  Where people look at one another and say, "I see you and I
   got your back!"

     Almost 1,000 Swartz Creek Middle School students and staff wearing
                          their #SCMShero T shirts

   Want To Learn More?
   Tony Suchanek will bring students from our Diversity Club to share on
   July 29, in Swartz Creek, Michigan at the [34]COLchat To Action
   Conference.  Come meet these heroes in person and learn how you can
   start a movement in your school!

[43]A Letter To My Son On His 13th Birthday

   By Michele Corbat
   [44][photo+1+(1).JPG]
   Dear Brady,
   Today is a special day.  Today you are thirteen!  It does not seem
   possible that you are turning thirteen.  It was only yesterday that I
   was in labor with you for 15 hours...scared...and hoping that you would
   be healthy.  It took forever for you to be born. I was exhausted and
   almost to the point of giving up, telling the doctor that I couldn't
   push any more. However, I found the energy to try to push one more time
   and finally you were born (only four minutes from Friday the 13th).  As
   exhausted as I was, all of that faded away the moment the doctor handed
   you to me, my beautiful son. You had jet black hair and the biggest
   blue eyes.  You were amazing, so tiny and perfect and beautiful and
   such a gift from God.  I have been more amazed by you as you have
   grown.  I thank God in trusting me with the gift of being your mother.
   The past 13 years have definitely been the most blessed learning
   experience in my entire life. I am certain that I will continue
   learning from you in the years to come.  You have taught me how to love
   unconditionally not expecting anything in return, how to enjoy the
   small things in life, how to be carefree.  All the way home from our
   vacation today, my mind was flooded with memories as I was driving.
   The times we danced in the living room with the stereo blaring, the
   times you'd help me 'clean' with your mini-vacuum, when I found you
   hiding behind the recliner using nose hair trimmers to shave your head,
   playing grocery store and McDonalds with you in our basement, your
   first day of school as I cried my eyes out putting you on the bus,
   watching you play tee-ball (picking weeds), then baseball (hustling
   behind the plate as catcher), cracking up at your spot-on
   impersonations, watching you act as the third parent for Austin
   (#firstbornprobs) and watching you comfort him when times have been
   difficult. The list is endless.  Thank you! You have made my life
   worthwhile. You have been one of the brightest lights of my life.
   Someday I hope you look back and read this letter with a different
   perspective than you do today. As you begin your journey as a teenager
   I want you to know a few things.
   1.  Stay close to God in all times.  When you are feeling stressed or
   overwhelmed, talk to Him.  When you are feeling blessed and thankful,
   talk to Him.  Change is constant and life is short.  God will be with
   you through it all.
   2.  Dad and I love you.  There are going to be times that it may seem
   that we are 'lame' when you ask to do something that 'all of your
   friends' are doing and we say no.  Please know that every decision we
   make is out of love.  We want the best for you and want to protect
   you.
   3.  Be a good big brother.  Austin ADORES you.  He watches everything
   you do and say, often imitating you.  Be a good role model for him.
   When you make mistakes, admit them and then change your ways.  He is
   going to be there for you long after Dad and I are gone.  Make time for
   him.  Nurture your relationship with him.
   4.  There are going to be girls that come and go in your life. There
   will be heartbreaks.  Choose the ones that are special to you. Most
   importantly, treat them with respect, and respect yourself. Treat
   every girl as God's property. Treat yourself as God's property.
   Remember that you can talk to Dad and me for advice.
   5.  Be kind.  Be a great friend to others.  Be the person that people
   can count on and trust.  Treat people with respect and give everyone a
   chance.  Remember that everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing
   about.
   6.  There are going to be some rough times as a teenager.  There will
   be days when life is awesome, but there will be many that it seems the
   world is against you. In those days, I want you to remember, Dad and I
   have your back. Always. No matter what. Take it slow, you don't have to
   grow up overnight (even though you keep reminding me how many years
   until driver's training or college).
   I am so proud of you! You bring joy to my heart and I love being your
   mother. Every day is a blessing and the best is yet to come.
   Love you always and forever,
   Mom

[54]Reflections on #MACUL14

   by Michele Corbat
   [55][MACUL.PNG]
   I attended the [56]2014 MACUL Conference along with some of my
   colleagues.  There were countless, amazing technology tools shared and
   I have an Evernote document loaded with these tools.  However, the
   tools were not my main take away from this conference.  My take away
   was the importance of establishing relationships and connections with
   one another.  Every keynote address and every session that I attended
   included stories about the power of connections and relationships.
   My eyes welled with tears during  [57]Adam Bellow's mind-blowing
   keynote address when he shared [58]this video clip of John Berlin's
   emotional appeal to Facebook to unlock his late son's account. After
   his son passed away, John wanted to watch his son's "Look Back" video,
   and thankfully got the opportunity.  The technology enabled John to
   connect with his son one more time.  Adam reminded us that technology
   allows us to capture the meaningful experiences in life and to create
   the big ones.
   [59][Bellow.JPG]
   Then I heard more stories from [60]Todd Nesloney, better known on
   Twitter as [61]TechNinjaTodd,  Todd shared his journey in creating a
   flipped project based learning classroom.  One of the first statements
   he made was, "Relationships are number one.  If you are not building
   relationships, then nothing I am saying will work in your classroom."
   AMEN!  Todd told us about the [62]Math Fair he does with his students
   and how it has been the highlight of his career.  I was inspired
   listening to him explain how proud the students were of their learning
   because they could choose their project based on their passion.  Todd
   understands the importance of establishing relationships with students
   and making his classroom a place where students want to be.
   At the end of the first day of the conference, my last session was on
   Game Changing Apps by [63]Drew Minock, Brad Waid and Todd Nesloney.
   Once again, the power of connections came up.  One of the game changing
   apps the guys shared was Cargo-Bot.  Brad shared a story of one of his
   former students who was a mute.  This student talked to no one for
   years.  However, once this student was introduced to Cargo-Bot, he
   became inspired.  After several weeks of working with Cargo-Bot, this
   student spoke.  He was the first to volunteer his group to do a
   presentation to the class on Cargo-Bot.  He even led the presentation!
   Brad explained that you never know what's going to impact, inspire or
   engage one of your students.  It could be a connection with technology.
   [64][2+guys.JPG]
   Throughout the second day of the conference I continued to hear stories
   about the importance of relationships and connections from [65]George
   Couros.  George told us about how his father, an immigrant from
   Greece, learned to use Facebook and FaceTime.  Why did he choose those
   tools?  Because he knew that was the way he would connect with his
   children and grandchildren.  He told the story of Alyssa, a seven year
   old girl from Australia whose father helped her start a blog.  Alyssa
   posted a video to her blog that George took at a Justin Bieber concert
   and her father tweeted it.  Teachers around the world commented on
   [66]Alyssa's blog and she would rush home from school each day to read
   the comments.  The power of connections using technology inspired and
   motivated this child to write more blog posts.
   An idea was also born out of this conference.  An idea on encouraging
   other teachers and administrators to become connected.  Some of the
   #michEd crew including,  [67]Todd Bloch, [68]Jeff Bush, and [69]Mike
   Kaechele connected with me at the end of the second day to ask if my
   #COLchat team would be interested in joining them in submitting a
   proposal to present at the 2014 Michigan Association of Secondary
   School Principals' Conference.  We set up a Google Hangout with my
   administrators and #COLchat co-moderators, [70]Adam Hartley and
   [71]Rodney Hetherton.  We are working on our proposal now and the focus
   will be how a culture of learning can be created through relationships
   and when educators are connected.
   George Couros said, "To inspire meaningful change you must make a
   connection to the heart."  It's about the relationships and connections
   that we make NOT about the technology itself.  We need to be sure that
   we are not missing the best part of the internet--the power of
   connections.  This is the big idea that I want to share with my
   colleagues when I return to school this week.  This is the big idea
   that will continue to be my focus with my school community.  I will
   take what I learned from MACUL14 and put it into action.  I will focus
   on relationships and connections.
   Thank you to all who spent countless hours organizing or preparing
   presentations for the MACUL14 conference.  I am grateful for the
   opportunity to have connected with so many passionate educators from
   Michigan and across the world!

[80]Reminders on Kindness

   By Michele Corbat

     "I have this theory that if one person can go out of their way to
     show compassion, then it will start a chain reaction of the same.
     People will never know how far a little kindness can go."

     Rachel Joy Scott (1981-1999)
     Student, First Victim Of The Columbine High School Massacre

   Do you know about [81]Rachel's Challenge?  If you don't, stop reading
   this RIGHT NOW and check it out.  I've [82]written about this
   before when people in my life have reminded me about the impact of
   kindness.  I've been reminded of this in two very powerful ways once
   again.
   The first way breaks my heart into a million pieces.  The first way is
   how heart-breaking it is to others when we are intentionally unkind.
   Maybe you haven't heard yet, but there's a new fad going around where
   high school and middle school Confessions accounts are popping up all
   over Twitter.  Or maybe it has been going on for a while and I am just
   finding out.  These accounts are places for students of these schools
   to send anonymous tweets that are supposed "confessions" along with
   their grade level.  These accounts are nothing more than horrible
   examples of keyboard courage.  According to
   [83]UrbanDictionary.com, keyboard courage is:

     Keyboard Courage

     Function: noun
     descriptive quality: 1: A quality or characteristic displayed by a
     person through the written word that this person would not
     ordinarily possess. 2: The confrontational attitude exhibited by
     someone via an anonymous entry to an internet web-page or posting.
     3: An attitude demonstrated by someone when they realize that
     actions taken by them or words written by them across a computer
     connection will have little, if any, personal repercussions. 4: A
     false bravery possessed by an individual who does not possess the
     true quality in person.

   Sadly, some of these accounts have shown up in my school district.  I
   have read the tweets.  Some are terribly hurtful and I wonder what the
   person named in the tweet is feeling.  Is she wondering what everyone
   will think when they see her at school?  Is he thinking that people
   will laugh at him and make fun of him?  Does he want to seek revenge
   for the anger he is feeling from his hurt?  Words are POWERFUL and
   unkind words can kill us!
   But then, I was also reminded of the power of kindness; how small acts
   of kindness can cause someone to feel loved, to make someone's day, to
   heal and to inspire.  My colleague, Chris Carney, is battling the fight
   of his life.  One month ago, he was diagnosed with cancer.  He has been
   feeling excruciating pain for more than a year with the sources not
   found until recently.  Chris is a popular teacher, one who children
   love.  It's not uncommon to walk past Chris' classroom and see him
   playing his guitar and singing to or with his children.  Or to see him
   dress up as Superman to remind children how they are heroes for their
   acts of kindness.  Chris' wife, Christy, is also a teacher in my
   school.  She is one of the sweetest and kindest people you could ever
   know.  It's not uncommon to find a note from Christy letting you know
   she is thinking about you and praying for you when she knows you are
   facing struggles.  It's no surprise that she's taking unpaid time off
   from school to care for Chris.
   When Chris was diagnosed, just days before Christmas, teachers,
   parents, and community members stepped up immediately to show the
   Carney's just how much we love them.  Within days, a benefit was
   organized with information shared on Facebook and Twitter accounts.
   People jumped in to lead committees, businesses donated gift cards and
   merchandise, students made cards and wrote letters, and teachers
   donated sick days.  One act of kindness led to another act of kindness
   and so on and so on.
   After only a few weeks of organizing, an amazing benefit took place
   yesterday.  The roads were ice-covered and temperatures were barely
   above 0, however HUNDREDS of people came.  People volunteered their
   time to work the various areas of the benefit.  Many donated more than
   the minimum amounts for admission or bake sale items. It was the top
   story on our local news.  Check it out [84]here. At this point, more
   than $17,000 has been collected and this amount continues to grow as
   donations are still rolling in.  Acts of kindness filled the entire
   room!
   However, Chris and Christy were not able to come to the benefit as
   Chris has only recently been released from the hospital and cannot
   compromise his immune system.  But the power of technology did not stop
   us from bringing them there.  The best part of the day for me, were the
   times we spent connected with Chris and Christy through our Skype
   visits.   To see their students, past and present, come to the iPad and
   tell them "I love you" or "We miss you", made my heart smile.  To see
   Chris and Christy smile from ear to ear as people talked with them was
   the best feeling in the world.  When we told them that $12,000 had been
   raised by 5:00 with still two hours to go, the expressions on their
   faces said it all!

   We all need to remember that what we say and what we do matters.  Life
   is short.  Rachel Scott said, "Tomorrow is not a promise, but a
   chance."   Will our actions and words help others feel hope or feel
   despair?  It's our choice.  I choose kindness.  I choose acts of
   love.  It feels so much better!

[94]A Journey to Healthier Grading Practices

   By Michele Corbat
   [95][Never-doubt-that-a.jpg]
   Today I was reminded that Margaret Mead was spot on when she said
   this.  I worked with our elementary standards based grading team.  This
   is a team of thoughtful, passionate individuals who are changing our
   little corner of the world for students.

   In my district, [96]Swartz Creek Community Schools, we have had
   standards based report cards in place at the elementary level for
   about 5 years.  This was before Common Core State Standards were
   adopted by my state.  Over the years, our teachers have worked to make
   some tweaks to the report cards, but the cards have not really been
   fully aligned to CCSS.  This year a group of elementary teachers, led
   by [97]Rodney Hetherton, was invited to represent their grade level and
   school building to work together on revising our report cards.  Our
   revised report cards will better reflect the CCSS for ELA and
   mathematics.

   The team has only met three times, however the work these dedicated
   teachers have done is amazing!  It speaks volumes of their commitment
   to take positive steps in better communicating grade-level expectations
   for student learning.  It was obvious to me from the first meeting that
   a culture of learning existed on this team.  There is trust amongst
   these 7 individuals.  They are honest with their questions about how
   they have been reporting student learning.  They are positive and
   supportive with one another.  People on the team feel safe to express
   confusion.  Our conversations are reflective and thoughtful.  They are
   reaching out to their building and grade level colleagues for input and
   come to each meeting reporting this feedback to the team.
   During our first two meetings, time was spent revisiting elements of
   standards based grading and the purposes of it. We discussed the
   purpose of a report card.  We discussed the differences between
   formative and summative assessments.  We discussed power standards. In
   between meetings, we collaborated using Google documents to record
   suggestions for ELA and math power standards.
   Like I mentioned earlier, today was only our third meeting.  The first
   two hours were spent discussing what makes an effective standards based
   report card. We reviewed examples from other school districts. I had to
   leave the meeting for another meeting (a typical day for me) and when I
   returned two hours later the team had the entire ELA-Writing portion of
   the report card revised.  Not just for one grade level, but for
   kindergarten through fifth grade.  They were thoughtful about the
   organization of the card to align to the CCSS anchor standards, spiral
   up through the grade levels and that the wording was parent-friendly.
   After a quick lunch, they spent a couple of more hours working
   collaboratively and revised the entire mathematics portion of the
   card.  Again, for kindergarten through fifth grade!
   Because these educators are so thoughtful, they spent the last portion
   of the day planning how to share the drafts of these revisions with our
   colleagues.  They want to ensure that teachers understand
   the rationale behind the revisions.  Conversations around how to
   educate our parents on the revisions also took place.  Maybe a team of
   parents will join us in a future meeting.  A guide to the revised
   report card will be developed with an FAQ section.  Ideas were
   collected and documented on our Google doc.  These details will be
   worked out in our next meeting.
   I am blessed to be a part of this team.  Margaret Mead was right.  My
   colleagues are thoughtful, committed people who are changing our little
   corner of the world.

     If you get grading right, it will support everything else you
     do.~Doug Reeves

   I was SHOCKED today to learn that two people I admire greatly nominated
   my blog for a Sunshine Award.  Educators, [108]Starr Sackstein and
   [109]Drew Frank, are two people I follow on Twitter.  Starr is a high
   school English/journalism teacher from New York.  She is the author of
   [110]Teaching Mythology Exposed (a must-read).  Drew is  Director of
   Academic Operations and Lower School Principal at [111]The Davis
   Academy in Atlanta, Georgia.  These individuals contribute to my
   learning, inspire and wow me with the ways they are reaching and
   influencing students every day.  In fact, if you aren't following these
   Edurockstars, stop reading this blog and go read their blogs right now.
   Being honored by your peers is a fantastic feeling. Being honored by
   these peers is especially amazing because I am in awe of them.
   Sunshine Award:
   According to the rules of the sunshine award I am required to:
   1.  Acknowledge the nominating blogger.
   2.  Share 11 random facts about myself.
   3.  Answer the 11 questions the nominating blogger has created for me.
   4.  List 11 bloggers that I believe deserve some recognition and a
   little blogging love!
   5.  Post 11 questions for the bloggers I nominate (cannot nominate the
   blogger who nominate me).
   11 Random Facts About Me:
    1. I LOVE music!  I don't have a favorite genre but know the lyrics to
       hundreds, if not thousands of songs.  Everything from Pink to Red
       Hot Chili Peppers to Kid Rock to Hank Williams Jr. to Luther
       Vandross!  I love it all.
    2. Before my kids were born, I spent my evenings teaching
       step-aerobics and kickboxing six days/week.  I was a lean, mean,
       fighting machine (well, not really, but it rhymes).
    3. My early career goal was to become a social worker.  I spent my
       first couple of years in college on this career path.
    4. My only sibling, Becky, was killed in a tragic car accident at age
       6.  I was in the car.  Our birthdays are 364 days apart (mine is
       3-17-69 and hers is 3-16-70).  I miss her.
    5. I spent 5 years working at a group home for developmentally
       disabled adults before I was hired as a teacher.
    6. I'm scared to death to walk on high school bleachers.
    7. My strange addiction:  Real Housewives of ANYWHERE (O.C., N.J.,
       Atlanta)
    8. My next strange addiction:  HGTV (Love House Hunters, Property
       Brothers, Love It or List It and so many more).
    9. I could live on eating cereal alone every day for the rest of my
       life.
   10. I don't untie my shoes when I take them off.
   11. I hope I can be the kind of parent to my kids that my parents were
       to me.

   11 Questions for me (From Starr):
    1. What made you want to go into education? I was inspired by my
       middle school math teacher, Johanna Brown.  She was creating a
       culture of learning back in the 80's with me and my peers.  Our
       paths crossed again my second year of college where she was my math
       teacher again.  I realized that I wanted to inspire others the way
       she inspired me.
    2. Which teacher made the greatest impact and why? I answered this in
       #1.
    3. What is your favorite professional learning?  Edcamps!  My first
       one was [112]nErDcampbc last summer and I was hooked.
    4. If you could recommend one professional book, what would it be and
       why?  Only one? Hmmm, I would recommend [113]Choice Words by Peter
       Johnston because it gives us the language and research to build
       healthy learning communities.
    5. What’s your favorite chat and why? When does it happen? After
       #COLchat and #SBGchat (*wink), my favorite chat is #satchat or
       #satchatwc.  These chats were my firsts as a newbie to Twitter and
       connected me to so many amazing educators around the world.  Both
       take place on Saturday mornings.
    6. What do you like to do on your “free” time? Ha, what's that?
    7. What is your most vivid childhood memory?  My fondest childhood
       memory is playing Sonny and Cher with my sister.  I was older so I
       made her be Sonny and we would do concerts for my parents.
    8. What’s one topic you could write about every day?  I could write
       about my children every day.  They help me to remember what's
       important in life and I am blessed to be their mom.
    9. What’s your favorite meal?  Spaghetti and meatballs
   10. Did you play any sport as a kid? if yes, which one(s)?  I played
       softball, volleyball, ringette (hockey for girls), and was on the
       swim team.
   11. What would you like to share that you haven’t already?  I need to
       write every day to sharpen my skills and deepen my reflection about
       teaching/learning.  I wanted to choose this for my [114]nerdlution,
       but I'm afraid that I won't be able to do it.

   11 Questions for me (From Drew):
    1. What is your favorite movie of all time?  The Green Mile
    2. If you could go to have attended any concert anytime in history,
       what would it have been?  I would have seen Pink's performance at
       the 2010 Grammy's.  Check out the video [115]here.
    3. What do you do for fun?  Hobby?  I like to spend time with my wolf
       pack (my 3 best friends that anyone could have).  We enjoy
       shopping, going to comedy shows, or just hanging at one of our
       houses for a girls' night in.
    4. What two guests would make the best comedic pair as co-hosts for
       the Oscars?  I enjoy Tina Fey and Amy Poehler (girl power).
    5. Cat, Dog or Goldfish? Why… Cat!  When I am stressed and my cat,
       Marley, jumps in my lap, my blood pressure goes down just by
       petting her.
    6. How do you caffeinate? I used to drink a fountain diet coke every
       day for several years.  Last year I gave that up and became
       addicted to coffee.  Now, I have one or the other only once/week.
    7. Favorite twitter chat?  See #5 from Starr's questions above.
    8. Best place you ever vacationed?  Ft. Lauderdale, FL with my husband
       and kids.  We went there about 4 years ago and had the most amazing
       time because of the beautiful weather, upgrades, and awesome people
       we met.
    9. Best book you’ve read in 2013? I just finished reading The First
       Phone Call From Heaven by Mitch Albom and am still reflecting on
       the lessons learned.
   10. Favorite television shows?  Pretty much any reality TV (I know that
       most of these shows are not real).
   11. What is one thing you never/rarely share that you are exceptionally
       proud of?  I can wrap my arms into a weird pretzel shape and then
       put them over my head.  It's rare that I meet someone else who can
       do this.  (not sure I'm proud of that)

   11 Bloggers that I believe deserve recognition:

   sunshine in my life!
