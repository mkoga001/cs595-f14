My Letter of Thanks & Appreciation to @WWEAJLee & #TeamAJ (for my 20th
Birthday)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dear A.J. Lee,
   My name is Alexander Miller. I’m a former child football player and
   current recreational weightlifter (for twelve years) with an ambition
   to become a WWE Superstar, the aspiration I’ve had since I was four
   years old. I would like to take this moment to dedicate my twentieth
   birthday to you and your other fans. A.J., I thank you for inspiring me
   to become a WWE Superstar and caring so much for us A.J. fans. I, as a
   young man who’s diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, don’t think you and
   your other fans have realized how much my passion for WWE has
   flourished because of you and your other fans’ support for me. At
   first, I used to be really insecure about being a grown man inspired by
   a WWE Diva to become a WWE Superstar in the near future, because I was
   made fun of. I know what it’s like for people to make fun of others.
   After a little while, I started to become more of a confident young
   man. I finally found someone to look up to like a big sister. I am who
   I am. You’ve shown me that height and gender don’t matter when it comes
   to inspiration. Like Lita and Trish, who are my other female idols, you
   have found a way to stand out differently from the other Divas in WWE.
   You guys have taught both male and female fans to not only be a fan of
   Divas considering their looks, but also for their talents, athletic
   abilities, wrestling abilities, charisma, personalities and characters,
   as well. I’m proud of you for doing these things and being different,
   but most importantly, being yourself. A.J., you’ve set so many good
   examples for boys, girls, men, women and the elderly both inside and
   outside the world of wrestling. It’s nice, great and amazingly awesome
   to know a lot about a young, geeky woman who cares for her fans,
   retweets and replies to her fans wearing her merchandise, compliments
   her fans on their fan art, loves wrestling, loves pets like her
   Chihuahua Nacho, video games, action movies and comic books and being a
   person people would love to hang out with and talk to. It’s also glad
   to see that you don’t care what other people think and I’m proud of you
   for not changing who you are. That makes you one of the best,
   influential, entertaining WWE Divas today, but only at what you do.
   You’ve paved the way for both present and future generations of WWE
   Superstars and Divas. You’ve proven that anybody inspired by a Diva can
   be as tough, athletic, determined and passionate as anybody inspired by
   a Superstar or a WWE Legend. Your life story speaks so much to me. You
   lived in poverty in your childhood, but you had the courage to save
   yourself and your family from it. I’ve heard stories of you making so
   many sacrifices to get to where you are now. That’s very valiant of you
   to break through glass ceilings and break down doors. You’ve proven
   that if you can do something like that, so can others. You’re one of
   those Divas who has proven that a Diva can inspire anybody, male or
   female, to do anything. Divas can do anything Superstars can do, only
   better. You’ve given me reason to believe that no matter the looks,
   race, style, height or weight, a person can do anything he/she sets
   his/her mind to as he/she sees fit. Like the WWE Superstars, Divas are
   athletes; they’re not sex objects or eye candy. You’ve become my queen,
   idol, inspiration, role model and mentor. Like your other fans, I see
   you as a potential friend of mine, as well. You taught me how to deal
   with haters and other people who tell me I’ll never amount to anything.
   I’ll never change who I am or what I am. I won’t let any insensitive
   people stop me from living my life and what I do. I’ve seen you deal
   with a lot of pressure from so many critics and detractors before, and
   look at where we are now. You’ve proven these people wrong. Before you
   came along, I used to have a really tough childhood and get in trouble
   several times. However, your presence and example have opened my eyes.
   Your spark, when you were a contestant on WWE NXT, had motivated me to
   be really interested in you and become a huge fan of you. You’ve
   changed my life and heart. You’ve made an impact on my life. Not only
   did you change my life, you saved it. As the years have passed, you’ve
   become a significant part of my life. My loyalty and your other fans’
   loyalty have encouraged me to make friends with tons of your fans.
   You’re one of the reasons I have become a better person. As an athlete
   who stands at six foot three, I would like to say that you have
   inspired me to work really hard, push myself harder towards my goals of
   becoming a WWE Superstar, care for you and your fans and protect you
   guys from haters, sickos, crazies and psychos. You've helped me be all
   about helping others and giving advice. That, of course, would dub me
   as the powerhouse of your fan base called #TeamAJ. You’ve taught me how
   to be protective of people who I really care about. Not only have you
   inspired me to become a WWE Superstar, you’ve taught me how to become
   an idol, inspiration and role model for your other fans, too, just like
   you are to them. No matter what you do, no matter if you’re a face or
   heel, no matter if you’re champion or not, one way or another, I’ll
   always support you through thick and thin until my last breath because
   I care about you and your fans. To be honest with you, you also
   inspired me not to back down, hence the reason I have a Twitter
   @dontbackdownANM, because I always say I don’t back down and tell other
   wrestling fans not to back down when it comes to their aspirations.
   Remember, when you and your other fans have nobody else to turn to,
   you’ve got me. You’ll see me in the ring one day. If you could find
   some time to respond, I would appreciate that, but I'll understand if
   you don't. Regardless, I’ll also appreciate if you and your other fans
   keep supporting me through thick and thin until the end, as well. I
   appreciate you & your other fans helping me go through good & bad
   times. I thank you guys! I wish you much the best of luck in WWE and
   other endeavors. Thank you and keep up the good work! Stay strong!
   Don’t back down! Keep thinking positively! Always keep your head up.
   That’s the bottom line, because Alexander Miller said so! Keep living
   your life and dreams.
   Yours Sincerely,
   Alexander N. Miller
