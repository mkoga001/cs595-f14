   Picture
   Welcome to the Delta Xi chapter of Alpha Phi! I hope our website allows
   you to see all that Alpha Phi at UNK has to offer.
   The Delta Xi chapter of Alpha Phi focuses strongly on the six values
   that all Alpha Phi chapters were founded upon—scholarship, sisterhood,
   service, leadership, loyalty, and character development. Scholarship is
   our main focus and we are consistently at the top of our campus
   regarding average GPA. While our grades are extremely important to us,
   we also make sure to be involved and give back at a local and national
   level. Each year, we hold two very successful philanthropy events, a
   male pageant called King of Hearts, and our Red Dress Poker Tournament,
   benefiting cardiac care.  Giving back to the community of Kearney and
   to Alpha Phi internationally is something that our women will always be
   proud of.
   Perhaps the most special thing about the Delta Xi chapter is our
   genuine and supportive sisterhood. Going through recruitment, I wanted
   to join a house with women that shared the same morals and values as
   me, and to be in something that made me grow as a person. That is
   exactly what I found in Alpha Phi. These women have pushed me to do
   things I never thought possible for myself, supported me through the
   ups and downs of college, and have truly changed me for the better in
   just three short years. This is what I want for every woman going
   through sorority recruitment—to find a sorority with women that make
   you a stronger and better person and truly find a home away from home.
   Thanks for visiting our website. I hope this has helped you get a
   glimpse of our amazing chapter and the PHI-nominal life of an Alpha
   Phi!
