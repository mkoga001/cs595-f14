   WELCOME

   Welcome to the Computational Genetics Laboratory in the [1]Institute
   for Quantitative Biomedical Sciences at [2]The Geisel School of
   Medicine and [3]Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH, USA.

   We are located at the [4]Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon,
   NH and are affiliated with the [5]Department of Genetics, the
   [6]Section of Biostatistics and Epidemiology in the [7]Department of
   Community and Family Medicine and the [8]Bioinformatics Shared Resource
   at the [9]Norris-Cotton Cancer Center.

   We are also affiliated with the [10]Department of Computer Science at
   the University of New Hampshire, the [11]Department of Computer Science
   at the University of Vermont, the [12]Department of Psychiatry and
   Human Behavior at Brown University and the [13]Translational Genomics
   Research Institute in Phoenix.

   We are also part of the graduate training program in [14]Molecular and
   Cellular Biology and the newly approved graduate training program in
   [15]Quantitative Biomedical Sciences (QBS) that trains students at the
   interface between bioinformatics, biostatistics, epidemiology and other
   discplines such as biomathematics, genomics, proteomics and systems
   biology.

   MISSION

   Our goal is to develop, evaluate and apply novel computational methods
   and software for identifying genetic and genomic biomarkers associated
   with human health and disease. Our focus is on methods that embrace,
   rather than ignore, the complexity of the genotype-to-phenotype mapping
   relationship due to phenomena such as epistasis. A new focus is on the
   development of visual analytics to facilitate this process.


   EPISTASIS

   A central focus of our research is the detection, characterization and
   interpretation of epistasis or gene-gene interaction. The word
   epistasis was coined by William Bateson in the early 1900s in his book
   Mendel's Principles of Heredity and was used to describe deviations
   from mendelian inheritance patterns due to one gene standing upon or
   modifying the effects of another gene.

   Our working hypothesis is that epistasis is a ubiquitous component of
   the genetic architecture of human health and disease due to the
   importance of biomolecular interactions that drive biological systems
   in a genotype-dependent manner. Canalization may provide an
   evolutionary explanation for why epistasis is so common.

   We make the distinction between biological and statistical epistasis.
   Biological epistasis is what Bateson had in mind and is the result of
   biomolecular interactions at the cellular level. In contrast,
   statistical epistasis is a population-level summary and is more similar
   to Sir Ronald Fisher's definition of epistacy or deviation from
   additivity in a linear statistical model. Our goal is to develop and
   use data mining and machine learning algorithms to model statistical
   epistasis. The ultimate goal is to infer biological epistasis using
   systems biology approaches such as network modeling.
