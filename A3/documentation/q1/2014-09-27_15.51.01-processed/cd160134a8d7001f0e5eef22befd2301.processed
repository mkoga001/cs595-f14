   [11]WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke with Fox News’
   Sean Hannity last night on the U.S. plan to destroy ISIS and the Senate
   Armed Services Committee hearing with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
   and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey.
   Sean Hannity: Joining me with more is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Good to
   see you.
   Sen. Ted Cruz: Sean, great to be with you.
   Hannity: Maybe you can shed some light, this policy of the President.
   Your reaction.
   Sen. Cruz: It's extraordinarily dangerous. From the beginning,
   President Obama's response to ISIS has been fundamentally unserious.
   Whether it is golfing while terror attacks or whether it is admitting
   candidly to the world that he has no strategy. This administration is
   not doing the job that we need of a commander in chief to defend our
   nation. Today we had Secretary Hagel, we had General Dempsey before the
   Armed Services Committee. I try to press them hard on the very simple
   question, if the objective were to destroy ISIS. Not to degrade them,
   not to limit their ability, but to destroy them within 90 days, what
   would be militarily necessary to do that. I'm sorry to say neither
   gentleman could say that. General Dempsey said the military can't do
   that. Their focus seems far more focused on issues of political
   reconciliations on side issues. They were more of a social worker than
   military leaders. [12]More

[18]Cruz ➡ Nuclear Iran is a Bigger Threat than ISIL!

   [25]‘Most significant threat to U.S. national security remains the
   threat of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons’
   Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq
   and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) could lead to a “massive loss of life” in
   the United States if it is not stopped, but added that he still
   believes Iran’s nuclear ambitions pose a greater threat to the U.S.
   than the Islamic State, in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon
   last week.
   The senator also tied Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Obama
   administration’s Iran policy, and warned the White House against using
   a military campaign against ISIL as an excuse to appease Tehran.
   “As grave as the threat from ISIS is, in my view the most significant
   threat to U.S. national security remains the threat of Iran acquiring
   nuclear weapons capability,” said Cruz. “The incoherence of the
   Obama-Clinton foreign policy will come to full flower if the peril of
   ISIS is used as an excuse to further appease Iran and facilitate their
   acquiring nuclear weapon capability.”
   He added that “everything President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John
   Kerry have done have increased the chances of Iran acquiring nuclear
   weapon capability, and have perversely increased the chances of future
   military conflict.”
   While Cruz has not said whether he will run for president in 2016, his
   response to one question suggested that the possibility is on his mind.
   “What should a strong president do [to prevent a nuclear Iran]? Well
   number one, I’ve introduced legislation in the Senate, comprehensive
   Iran sanctions legislation that demonstrates the direction I believe we
   should be taking,” said Cruz.
   Although he noted that he remains supportive of a new sanctions
   legislation introduced by Sens. Mark Kirk and Robert Menendez, he
   called the proposals “weak sauce.”
   “Kirk-Menendez on its face is pretty weak sauce. It lays out future
   contingencies in which ultimately sanctions will be re-imposed. That’s
   not a rational way to negotiate with religious extremists like [Iranian
   Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei,” said Cruz. [26]More

   [38]MIDLAND, TX (Local Big 2 News) -- The terrorist group, ISIS,
   continues to terrorize the Middle East and threatens Americans -- as
   ISIS members have now murdered two American journalists. These terrible
   acts of violence have local law enforcement on standby.
   "These people have said they're going to takeover, they're going to
   strike, they're going to hit, and we're going to be ready," said
   Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter.
   Ready for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS.
   "We do have plans in place, we have an operational plan that'll work,"
   said Painter.
   Sheriff Painter says he's armed with specific ISIS information from an
   online intelligence briefing.
   "There are ISIS cells that are operating in Juarez, Mexico," said
   Sheriff Painter.
   While Sheriff Painter doesn't believe West Texans are in immediate
   danger, his staff preps for the worst. [39]More

   html?format=embed

   [63]With foreign policy suddenly on the front burner of domestic
   politics, Sen. Ted Cruz said it “increases my interest” in changing the
   direction of the country and running for the White House.
   “Foreign policy has risen to the forefront, because it is clear that
   what we are doing isn’t working,” Cruz told “The Fine Print” during an
   interview in New Hampshire. “And I do think the American people in
   November 2014 and also November 2016 are going to be looking for
   leaders who want to work to restore America’s leadership in the world.”
   Cruz stopped short of saying he will definitely seek the 2016
   Republican presidential nomination, but is elevating his criticism of
   President Obama and his strategy for the threat posed by Islamic
   extremists.
   “So far, the president has not demonstrated that he’s taking ISIS
   seriously,” Cruz said.
   “They have declared hostile intentions on the United States; they have
   murdered American citizens; and they are in the process of
   consolidating power over a nation state where they would have billions
   of dollars of oil revenue where they could use to project terror here,”
   Cruz said. “What we ought to have is a direct, concerted, overwhelming
   air campaign to take them out.”
   While Cruz said he believes ISIS is in a vulnerable position at the
   moment, he said the opportunity to put the group into retreat is being
   squandered by the Obama administration.
   “They’re not on the run, because the single greatest failing of the
   Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy is that it has been untethered to
   national security,” Cruz said. “They have approached foreign policy as
   a press release. We drop a bomb here; we fire a missile there to make a
   statement, rather than being directed from a clear concrete military
   objective that is directly tied to U.S. national security interests.”

   [76][URGENT2.jpg]
   [77]LUBBOCK, Texas — A Tucson, Arizona kidnapping and extortion plot of
   an American teen on U.S. soil was committed by previously deported
   illegal aliens from Mexico and a U.S. citizen who was arrested multiple
   times by Border Patrol agents for alleged alien smuggling and let go
   without prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. A group of six or
   seven men kidnapped the American teen in Tucson and mistakenly thought
   he belonged to a wealthy family. The men tortured the teen and insisted
   his parents hand over $400,000.

  [83]Senate Proposes ‘Severe Consequences’ for Americans Who Go to Fight With
  ISIS

   [84]Email This[85]BlogThis![86]Share to Twitter[87]Share to
   Facebook[88]Share to Pinterest

   [89][Capture%2Btc%2B3rd.PNG]
   [90]As ISIS continues its vicious killing campaign (with [91]U.S.
   citizens reportedly in its ranks), Senator Ted Cruz (R – TX) is
   introducing a bill next week that poses severe consequences for any
   would-be American terrorist.
   From our friends at the Washington [92]Free Beacon:
   With intelligence reports indicating that up to 100 Americans could be
   fighting with ISIL and similar terror groups in the Middle East, Cruz
   and other lawmakers have warned that current U.S. regulations do not
   prevent these American passport holders from slipping back into the
   United States, where they would pose a significant terror risk.
   The bill would effectively strip those Americans proved to be fighting
   alongside ISIL of their U.S. citizenship and block them from reentering
   the country. The legislation resembles a similar house bill by Rep.
   Frank Wolf (R., Va.) that also seeks to stem the flow of American ISIL
   fighters back into the country.
   Many on Twitter supported Cruz’s idea:
   [93][ISIS-TWEET-TEd-1.jpg?10ae6a]
   This user appreciated Cruz offering up something other than [94]“We
   don’t have a strategy yet:”
   [95][Ted-Cruz-2.jpg?10ae6a]
   The move even appeared to find common ground with those who don’t
   usually support the Senator:
   [96][Ted-Cruz-3.jpg?10ae6a]
   And this guy, well… he felt this kind of law should already be in
   place:
   [97][Ted-Tweet-4.jpg?10ae6a]
   It’s hard to determine how likely the chances are of an American
   joining ISIS and then returning to the United States carrying out a
   terrorist attack. [98]More

[103]Perry Indictment Part Of Ongoing Harassment Of Conservatives!

   [104]Email This[105]BlogThis![106]Share to Twitter[107]Share to

   [109][rick-perry-taking-over-for-george-w-bush-in-the-culture-war.img.j

   [110]The news of the indictment against Texas Governor Rick Perry on
   charges of abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public official
   surprised the country and shook up the early presidential race for
   2016. Debate ranged from how the charges would affect Perry’s chances
   at winning the Republican nomination and the White House to whether
   Perry would be convicted. A surprising number of liberals and Democrats
   have broken ranks to defend what many call an unconstitutional attempt
   to criminalize politics as usual. This is not the first time in recent
   memory that prosecutors have pressed charges against Republicans on
   dubious grounds. This harassment of conservatives is likely to worsen
   in the absence of penalties for malicious prosecution.
   In Texas, the Travis County DA office has prosecuted other high profile
   Republicans. In 1993, Rosemary Lemberg’s predecessor, Ronnie Earle,
   indicted newly elected U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison on charges of
   misusing her previous office of state treasurer according to
   [111]National Review. Hutchison was originally elected in a special
   election and faced the prospect of running for reelection in 1994 with
   the indictment hanging over her head. She pressed for a quick
   resolution and, when the case went to trial, Earle told the court that
   he could not proceed without the admission of records seized from
   Hutchison’s office without a search warrant. The judge promptly ordered
   the jury to return a verdict of not guilty.
