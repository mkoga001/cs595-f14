[15]Jimmy Fallon Presents Russian President Vladimir Putin's Reviews Of
American Films: VIDEO

   [16]PutinReviews

   Jimmy Fallon delivered some very real news in hilarious fashion last
   night, commenting on the [17]proposed boycott of Hollywood films in
   Russia based on U.S. sanctions and anti-Russian representation. It is
   undeniably true (and somewhat unfortunate) that the Russian villain has
   become an archetypical figure in American films and also, as politician
   Vladislav Grib commented, that "Russian pictures have a hard time
   reaching the screens and sometimes they are unable to do that at all.”
   As The Independent [18]reported, a Russian ban could severely impact
   international box office for American cinema: "Russia's box office is
   the eighth largest film market in the world."

   Fallon seemed to take the news in stride, however, and presented his
   audience with "Putin Movie Reviews" of popular Hollywood films Frozen,
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and new release, A Walk Among the
   Tombstones. It's a very funny bit, and they seemed to capture Putin's
   cynical voice perfectly.

[31]Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC) Claims He Never Called 'Firing Gays' a
'Freedom,' Despite Audio Track: LISTEN

   [32]RobertPittenger North Carolina congressman Robert Pittenger[33]
   fell into some hot water last week after a Think Progress reporter
   asked him his thoughts on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.
   Pittenger responded by referring to the right to employ/fire employees
   as one of "the freedoms we enjoy." Last Wednesday he attempted to right
   this wrong by issuing a factually incorrect statement including the
   line, "Americans are well protected already." Now, though, Pittenger is
   claiming that he never spoke those words, at least not in the context
   of gay and lesbian employees.

   The New Civil Rights Movement [34]reports:

   [35]MSNBC last week reported that Pittenger's communications director
   denied "that Pittenger discussed 'firing gay individuals,'" despite the
   fact that the question specified "gay or lesbian" people.

   “After the event, a blogger asked for an interview and then asked about
   [the Employment Non-Discrimination Act]. His opposition to ENDA was
   ‘translated’ into ‘firing gays’ by that blogger,” the director, Jamie
   Bowers, wrote in an email to msnbc on Friday.

   While Pittenger does quickly veer away from explicitly discussing the
   rights of gay and lesbian employees in the response, his entire
   statement is subject to be critiqued based on the question asked. At
   this point, it feels like a shoddy cover-up for a botched response.

[47]Gay Iconography: Is Britney A Worthy Icon?

   [48]Britney-Spears-Work-Bitch

   While few would argue the omnipresence of Britney Spears in many gay
   young men’s bedrooms, dance clubs and gyms, her status as a gay icon is
   certainly up for debate.

   On the one hand, she embodies so many of the qualities that have come
   to define a gay icon. She’s an over-the-top dance music diva whose
   brazen sexuality and come hither cooing have beguiled the public’s
   imagination since her late-‘90s debut. Veering further and further into
   camp, she’s got the costumes, elaborate Vegas show and even the cheesy
   feature film under her belt. Beyond the theatrics, like Marilyn and
   Judy before her, she’s got the tragic elements of her story as well.

   At the same time, she hasn’t exactly been the outspoken defender of the
   gay community like, say, Lady Gaga. In fact, she hasn’t very eloquently
   spoken on the subject at all. After patronizingly calling her gay fans
   “adorable” on-air at 99.7 NOW FM, she went on to give [49]a fascinating
   interview to Pride Source in which she failed to see why that could be
   seen as belittling and further described gay men as “somewhat girls.”

   OK. So she’s not going to be anyone’s first pick to speak at a rally
   any time soon. But, bless her heart, she means well. Right? Maybe she’s
   sort of like Donna Summer, who, despite her own complicated
   relationship with the gay community, stakes claim to a part of our
   culture.

   Explore some of the ways Britney made her mark, and share your
   thoughts, [50]AFTER THE JUMP …

[57]The Right Enemies: A Look Back at Right-Wing Attacks on Eric Holder

   [58]Holder resignation

   BY [59]LAYNE AMERIKANER

   Attorney General Eric Holder, who this week announced his plans to
   resign, has been a [60]leader in addressing systems of racial
   discrimination and protecting the fundamental rights of every American
   to be treated equally under the law and participate in our democracy.
   Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that the Right loves to hate him.
   [61]Tim Huelskamp In February of this year, the American Family
   Association [62]demanded Holder’s impeachment after he had the
   [63]audacity to treat married same-sex couples like married
   opposite-sex couples with regard to a host of legal rights and
   recognitions. Shortly after, both [64]Faith and Freedom Coalition head
   Ralph Reed and Republican [65]Rep. Tim Huelskamp [pictured right]
   echoed the call for Holder’s impeachment because of his support for
   marriage equality. Televangelist Pat Robertson also [66]joined the
   impeachment parade, alleging that under Holder, “sodomy” was being
   “elevated above the rights of religious believers.”
   Holder’s commitment to redressing racial injustice was no more warmly
   received by the Right than his work in support of LGBT equality. After
   Holder spoke out against voter ID laws, which [67]disproportionately
   harm people of color, Texas Gov. Rick Perry accused him of
   “purposefully” “[68]incit[ing] racial tension.” Gun Owners of America
   director Larry Pratt argued that Holder’s open discussion of racial
   discrimination in the criminal justice system means that he is the real
   “[69]racist,” asserting last year that Holder wants to “intimidate the
   rest of the country so that we don’t think about defending ourselves”
   against “[70]attacks by black mobs on white individuals.” Bryan Fischer
   of the American Family Association went so far as to say that Holder
   would never “prosecute someone [71]if the victim is white.” And after
   Holder visited Ferguson, Missouri last month, David Horowitz
   outrageously commented that the attorney general was leading a black
   “[72]lynch mob.”
   And those are just a handful of the attacks the Right has leveled
   against Holder for his work protecting equality under the law.
   The fact that the far Right has reacted with so much vitriol to the
   attorney general’s leadership is a sign not only of how uninterested
   they are in the civil rights that the Justice Department is meant to
   protect, but also of how effective Holder’s work has been. The next
   attorney general should share Holder’s deep commitment to protecting
   the rights of all Americans – and, by extension, make all the “right”
   enemies among those hoping to turn back the clock on civil liberties.

[93]Detroit Area Catholic High School Administrators to Review Policies After
Firing Pregnant Gay Teacher

   [94]Webb

   Administrators at a Detroit-area Catholic high school have announced
   they will review policies and procedures following the
   [95]controversial firing of a gay teacher who claimed she was sacked
   last month because of her pregnancy, The Detroit News [96]reports:

   Mary Jane Herb, president of the Monroe-based Sisters, Servants of the
   Immaculate Heart of Mary, in a letter to supporters this week referred
   to "the recent employment matter" and "a complexity of issues" facing
   the Catholic church and its schools. She did not specifically name
   Barbara Webb, the teacher who was terminated last month from the
   private, all-girls Bloomfield Hills school.

   "Consequently, we need to have ongoing education and a new lens through
   which to view issues and situations that are emerging," Herb wrote in
   the letter dated Monday. "Pope Francis has brought a sense of hope to
   our lives and encourages us to look at our Church with new eyes. No, it
   is not likely that doctrine will change, however the Pope emphasizes
   that the values of mercy, inclusion and compassion need to be included
   in our response to complex situations."

   Earlier this month, Webb [97]revealed that her termination letter
   didn't give any reasons for the firing, but that previous conversations
   with school officials pointed to her violating a morality clause
   allowing for firing over public conduct of "lifestyle or action
   directly contradictory to the Catholic faith."

   The Detroit News [98]adds that a [99]change.org petition asking the
   high school to end its discriminatory anti-LGBT policies has gathered
   nearly 70,000 signatures.
