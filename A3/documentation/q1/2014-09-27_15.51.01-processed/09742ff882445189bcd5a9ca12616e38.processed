[14]Do Females Make Better Minecraft Players Than Males?

   [15][6a014e8bcff93b970d01bb078aca90970d-200pi]

   By Stewart Tate It goes without saying that Minecraft is a fun, trendy
   way to get your indie gaming fix these days and it’s not hard to see
   why. Minecraft has it all. You get to fight monsters. You can
   experience the accomplishment that comes with creating something and

[25]Your House Looks Great, Your Controller Is Filthy

   [26][6a014e8bcff93b970d01b8d06c406f970c-200pi]

   Whether you’re playing on a console or PC, Minecraft is one of those
   games that you can play for so long that you’re probably going to end
   up eating and drinking while you’re playing. While you’re busy
   gathering resources, this can create a situation where your controller
   is swimming in... [27]Read more →

[36]Seven spectacular Minecraft creations

   By Joe MillerTechnology reporter Many of us will have been first
   introduced to Minecraft when Microsoft announced it was paying $2.5bn
   (£1.5bn) for the company behind the best-selling video game. But for
   several years now a dedicated community has been beavering away in the
   Minecraft universe, painstakingly creating intricate cyberspace...

[47]Minecraft: Why are kids, and educators, so crazy for it?

   Minecraft stands rather uniquely in the gaming world as well for the
   fact that both boys and girls are drawn to it. That’s a rare thing in
   gaming, where so many games are male-oriented and focused on shooting
   and destroying, and where so many female-oriented games are dismissed
   as lightweights.... [48]Read more →

   [57][6a014e8bcff93b970d01a73e14a6f6970d-200pi]

   By Stevie Endercreep Creepers have made a bad name for themselves in
   the world of Minecraft. Their habit of creeping up onto unsuspecting
   players and self exploding have not made them very popular but when you
   look like a giant green willy, is it that surprising that they have

[67]Awesome Piece of Minecraft Gear

   [68][6a014e8bcff93b970d01a73e1442e8970d-200pi]

   You're a serious Minecraft fan. Your creations are the envy of all, and
   not a day goes by where you don't spend at least a little time
   building, fighting, or just running around hitting stuff to see what
   will happen. And now you've decided to take your love of Minecraft...

   There’s really no way around the fact that Minecraft is a great game.
   Like all great video games, it’s easy to sit for hours playing it,
   sometimes forgetting how much time you’ve actually spent in front of
   the computer already. Unfortunately, doing this can cause some real
   issues for your... [81]Read more →

[100]Getting the Best of the Best Armor in Minecraft

   If you have a good suit of armor, it’s a lot easier to stay alive while
   you are exploring the world of Minecraft. Minecraft gives you four
   pieces of armor that you can create. You can create a helmet to protect
   your head, a chest plate to protect your midsection,... [102]Read more

   If Minecraft is the only game you’ve played, you may not be familiar
   with the idea of modding. Modding involves taking a videogame and
   adding or removing features to it to make it slightly different. Where
   Minecraft is concerned, there are a lot of great mods out there that
