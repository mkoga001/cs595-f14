[12]Dear El Mundo: This is an absolute shame

   It's sad to see a former employer committing a mortal visualization
   sin. [13]El Mundo, the newspaper I used to work for between 2000 and
   2005, has just published the charts below, comparing the circulations
   of the three major national papers in Spain. As media critic [14]Josu
   Mezo has pointed out in his blog, the main problem isn't the lack of a
   0 baseline (I don't think that line charts always need one) but the
   fact that the Y-axis is truncated in the middle, to suggest that El
   Mundo is closer to [15]El País than it really is.
   This is an absolute disaster and, knowing that my ex-colleagues at El
   Mundo's infographics department take their job very seriously, I'm
   nearly 100% certain that this is the product of an overzealous top
   editor trying to massage the data to mislead readers, something that
   [16]seems to be common practice in my country. Shame on you.
   Mezo has published [17]new versions of the charts in which the Y-axis
   has been corrected.

[27]SciAm visualizes the PhD gender gap

   [28]Scientific American has just published an interactive visualization
   titled [29]‘How Nations Fare in PhDs by Sex.’ I'm still exploring it,
   but there are many things that I like about it already. To begin with,
   the filters in the drop-down menu on top, or the fact that we can sort
   the countries in different ways with the buttons underneath the chart.
   And the bubbles —yes, I do like bubbles (no matter what [30]you may
   have heard out there) when they are well used: Never for accurate
   comparisons, but to offer a general idea of what the data looks like.
   [31]Periscopic designed the graphic, and the research was done by
   [32]Amanda Hobbs.

[42]UNICEF's A Promise Renewed visualization

   If you follow this blog or my [43]Twitter account (or read my book!)
   you've probably noticed that I'm interested in topics related to global
   health, human development, etc. Because of that, I'd like to showcase
   [44]UNICEF's latest visualization, titled [45]‘A Promise Renewed’. It
   was designed by [46]Jan Willem Tulp who, as you probably remember,
   [47]I interviewed for The Functional Art.
   I asked the UNICEF folks to write a couple of paragraphs about the
   project:

     This data visualization was created to coincide with the launch of
     the annual [48]Committing to Child Survival: A Promise Renewed
     report, which uses data from UNICEF to provide an update on global
     progress around maternal, newborn and child survival.
     This year’s report makes encouraging reading: the number of under-5
     deaths worldwide has been halved since 1990, falling from 12.7
     million to 6.3 million in 2013. Nevertheless, the report emphasises
     that this still equates to 17,000 under-fives dying every day, or
     one every five seconds, and in 2013, one million newborn babies died
     on the day they were born. This is all the more tragic given that
     the majority of these deaths can be prevented using simple,
     affordable solutions such as folic acid supplementation, skilled
     birth attendance and early initiation of breastfeeding. The report
     calls for concerted action to improve quality of care for newborns
     and under-fives, led by governments, civil society and the private
     sector.

[58]Multimedia storytelling and visualization by Folha de São Paulo

   The more stories that tightly integrate text, photos, motion graphics,
   and visualizations I see, the more I like them ([59]here's an old post
   about them; and [60]here's a newer one.) The latest example I've seen
   has just been published by Folha de São Paulo, and it's titled
   [61]Crystal Unclear. They've translated it to English. It's about the
   future of water supply in Brazil.

[71]More about annotation and narration in infographics

   [72][1frisk.png]
   I'm not going to add much to my idea of an
   annotation-narration-storytelling continuum in this post. I'll try to
   develop it further and explain it in my next book. For now, [73]you can
   read about it here. Nonetheless, I'd like to bring attention to a good
   example: The latest infographic by [74]Ford Fesseden, published today
   by The New York Times. It demonstrates how to integrate words and
   visuals. [75]Its interactive version, co-designed by [76]Mike Bostock,
   is also mind blowing.

[86]Visualizing the fashion landscape

   Quartz has just published [87]a nifty scatter plot designed by
   [88]Jenni Avins and [89]David Yanofsky. Here's the description:

     The fashion industry loves Instagram, especially during Fashion
     Month—the semi-annual series of Fashion Weeks in New York, London,
     Milan, and Paris, that we are smack in the middle of at present.
     Instagram is chicer than Facebook, more visual than Twitter, and
     more intimate than both, so it lends itself nicely to voyeurism. So
     who is the fashion industry following—and followed by—on Instagram?
     From the accounts everyone knows to "deep fashion" insiders, Quartz
     analyzed 1.8 million Instagram accounts to determine which
     fashion-related users are the most followed, inside the industry and
     out.

   I love how the graphic looks, but what I like the most ([90]as you may
   understand) is how it's annotated and narrated. If you click on the
   “next” button underneath [91]the chart, you'll see some interesting
   highlights and explanations. I like to tell my students [92]at the
   University of Miami that graphics and words are equally important when
   creating a visualization. This project is an example of that principle.
   (Side note: Notice the logarithmic scale. The picky professor in me
   wants to ask for a button to switch back and forth between logarithmic
   and arithmetic scales. This is an interactive visualization after all.)

[102]New talk by Hans and Ola Rosling

   IFRAME: [103]//www.youtube.com/embed/Sm5xF-UYgdg

   Hans Rosling, mentioned in my [104]other post today, has just
   published [105]a new TED talk in his [106]website. As usual, it's
   funny, entertaining, and insightful. If you want to understand the
   “help us cross the river of myths (with data and analysis)” motto I
   [107]mentioned, watch it.
   This time, Rosling shares the stage with his son, [108]Ola, responsible
   for many of the graphics and interactive [109]visualizations used in
   these talks. He's a gifted speaker, too. It must be something genetic.
   His part of the presentation is focused on why our intuitions
   consistently get facts about the world wrong.
   Side note: I saw Rosling Sr. at the [110]Tableau Customer Conference
   just a few days ago, where I was a speaker. A couple of photos of the
   session:

  [121]Facing the Dataclysm

   [122][1dataclysm.jpg]
   At last, a “big data” book that is well written.
   You could argue that other recent books about numbers, like Kaiser
   Fung's [123]Numbersense and Jordan Ellenberg's [124]How Not to Be
   Wrong, are far from dull, and you'd be right. But they aren't about
   “big data” per se; they are about classic numeracy. Christian
   Rudder's [125]Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One's Looking),
   on the other hand, is about “big data”, whatever that term means, and
   also about how we can take advantage of it to know ourselves better.
   The book consists of a long series of stories with a common theme: Good
   data and analysis are the best antidote to prejudices and biases. Hans
   Rosling —whose motto [126]“help us cross the river of myths” should be
   adopted as a battle cry by information designers and journalists
   alike— would be proud.
   Needless to say, this post is just an excuse to recommend the book,
   even if I have only read half of it, around 150 pages. I began last
   night; that should give you an idea of how much I like it already. I
   foresee that it'll be among my favorites [127]this year. I'm sharing
   some photos (see below) I took while highlighting and writing notes on
   the margins. Notice the beautiful charts. There are tons of them.
   Related links: [128]Rudder's blog, and review by the [129]New Yorker.
   UPDATE: Two mathematicians that I follow closely have written about
   Dataclysm and reached opposite conclusions. [130]Jordan Ellenberg likes
   it quite a lot, and [131]Cathy O'Neil hates it.
   Even if I'm inclined to side with Ellenberg in this case, O’Neil's
   in-depth critique is excellent. However, I think that Rudder was
   anticipating some of the problems that she mentions. Just to give you
   an example, I read the entire book with this idea on the back of my
   mind: “This analysis applies only to users of dating websites.” I think
   that I did this unconsciously because Rudder himself suggests it at
   least twice (I'd need to double-check this to be sure.) He certainly
   gets carried away in some chapters, and extracts sweeping conclusions,
   though.
   Although it's true, as O'Neil says, that some parts of the book (like
   the one about race) go too far, Dataclysm is far from being sloppy. It
   has plenty of thoughtful passages about the issues that the ubiquity of
   data may pose, to begin with. Judge for yourself by reading the last
   two or three pages shown at the bottom of this post. You may disagree
   with Rudder's enthusiasm about what the future holds, but a fool he is
   not.

[141]Student work at Places&Spaces

   The [142]Places&Spaces exhibit and lecture series opened officially
   this past Thursday at the University of Miami. The event was a success
   (free food and [DEL: booze :DEL] drinks may have something to do with
   that...) [143]Here's a story about it.
   Now, we're working on the next presentations:
   VisualComplexity's [144]Manuel Lima, [145]Carie Penabad, [146]Nigel
   Holmes, [147]Stephen Few, [148]John Grimwade, [149]Patricia van Dalen,
   and many others. Please sign up for free through the links [150]on this
   page. Nigel has designed a poster to promote his talk, which we'll
   display all over campus soon. See it at the bottom of this post. Isn't
   it funny?
   Some work by local students is part of the exhibit. In the photo below,
   my student [151]Nancy Cermeño proudly presents one of her projects for
   my [152]infographics and visualization class. She asked me to use this
   caption: “Nancy Cermeño can't believe her Information Art is on
   exhibit!”

[163]ProPublica's latest multimedia visualization is simply beautiful

   I feel so relieved: I can finally stop keeping my mouth shut. As you
   may remember, I spent more than a month working with ProPublica over
   the summer (see [164]here and [165]here.) It was an amazing and
   humbling experience. While I was there, [166]Al Shaw, [167]Brian
   Jacobs, and [168]Bob Marshall were putting together an ambitious
   mapping project about the coast of Louisiana which required, among
   other things, tons of data, on-the-ground reporting, and satellite
   image stitching ([169]read a related blog post.) [170]The project,
   titled Losing Ground, has just been launched, and it's a gorgeous
   example of how to combine text, photos, audio, video, maps, graphics,
   and interactive elements.
   UPDATE: [171]A behind the scenes article about this project.

[181]To make visualizations that are truthful and persuasive, show all
relevant data

   Today, the NYT's The Upshot published [182]a very nice line chart
   showing projections of Medicare spending per recipient. This one:
   [183][1plot1.png]
   My reaction when I saw it was to [184]ask for another chart with total
   projected spending ([185]I wasn't the only one.) It's likely that the
   U.S. will have a larger number of retirees in the future than it does
   now, and arithmetic is a bitch: ‘Spending per recipient’ times ‘number
   of recipients’ can kill the best optimistic story.
   Here's why I wanted that second chart: If you're a diehard fan of The
   New York Times, like me, you'll be inclined to buy this argument.
   You'll trust [DEL: David Leonhardt :DEL] [186]Margot Sanger-Katz when
   [187][DEL: he :DEL]  she writes that projections reveal a positive
   trend, no matter the way you look at the data. But what about if I were
   a regular reader of [188]The Weekly Standard (just to mention one
   high-brow conservative publication)? I wouldn't be persuaded by these
   NYT egghead liberals*. I believe that I'd need to see all the relevant
   data, both the spending per recipient and the total spending, to be
   convinced.
   I thought that this could be a great example for class, so I began
   looking for the data. I visited the [189]CBO report mentioned in the
   story, and found the [190]one from last year. Here's a screenshot of
   the most recent projection of total Medicare spending in the next ten
   years:
   [191][1.plot.png]
   I was planning to design the second line chart myself but, fortunately,
   [192]Kevin Quealy, author of the original graphic, [193]had already
   done it. See it below. Numbers are in millions of dollars.
   I'll stick to my guns in this case: Both charts are equally relevant to
   the story. I'd publish them next to each other. The future certainly
   looks brighter than a year ago, but not as bright as the first chart
   may lead us to think. Alex Walsh [194]made an additional interesting
   suggestion.
   UPDATE: Sanger-Katz has just shared a link to [195]a story explaining
   demographic trends.
   *I don't know if [DEL: Leonhardt :DEL] Sanger-Katz and Quealy are
   liberals, of course, but The New York Times is generally considered a
   publication that sympathizes with liberal ideas.

  [205]More about plagiarism in visualization and infographics

   In the past few years I've written quite a lot about the boundary
   between plagiarism and inspiration in infographics and visualization
   (read [206]1, [207]2, [208]3, [209]4.) Last night, someone sent me
   [210]this visualization. It's eerily similar to [211]this NYTimes
   oldie, isn't it? Good topic for a class discussion: Is this plagiarism,
   inspiration, or simply the fact that there are certain stories that can
   only be told through specific graphic forms? In this case I'm inclined
   to say that it's a blatant copy, but I'd like to read your opinions.
   Screenshots of the new graphic vs. the NYT's one, below.
   UPDATE: The Retale people have just added a footnote to their graphic:
   “Inspired by: How Different Groups Spend Their Day, 2009. New York
   Times.”

[221]Ben Jones wants you to communicate data

   [222][1tableau.jpg]
   Just a brief post to shamelessly promote Ben Jones' book
   [223]Communicating Data With Tableau —because I've been using it
   lately, [224]as I explained here, and because it's really good, so I
   feel in debt with him.
   Two samples are available online. [225]The first one is going to be one
   of the mandatory readings in my upcoming visualization courses at the
   [226]University of Miami. The second one includes [227]chapter 4, on
   calculating rations and rates.
   The book is a nice companion to the [228]tutorials that Tableau
   uploaded a while ago. Well, to be honest, the video tutorials are a bit
   boring for my taste, as they focus mostly on the business analytics
   side of the program. Ben's book deals with visualization for
   communication, so if you are a designer or a journalist, this may be a
   good place to start.
   Ben also has a blog, [229]Data Remixed, and he's quite active [230]on
   Twitter.

[240]Places&Spaces arrives to the University of Miami

   The opening of the [241]Places&Spaces visualization exhibit and lecture
   series is two weeks away. Many people at the [242]University of Miami
   are working hard to get everything ready. I shot some photos of the
   installation this morning. The first ones show UM School of
   Architecture's Glasgow Hall, where half of the exhibit will be hosted,
   and where the talks by [243]Katy Börner, [244]Manuel Lima, [245]Nigel
   Holmes, [246]John Grimwade, [247]Stephen Few, etc., will take place.
   The photos at the bottom were shot at UM's [248]Richter Library, where
   the second half of the exhibit will be displayed.
   As I've already [249]explained, you can attend any of the talks for
   free, but [250]you'll need to sign up (see link beside each lecture
   title,), as space is limited. We are also planning to record the talks,
   and make them available at our [251]visualization website. but I don't
   have all the details about that yet.

[263]Some words about constructive criticism

   Forgive me in advance if this post sounds like a bland platitude, but
   if there's something I've learned the hard way in ten years teaching
   information graphics is that (1) we should always candidly criticize
   what we think is wrong if —and only if— (2) we can clearly explain why
   it's wrong, and (3) if we are willing to do it in a considerate manner.
   I write this knowing that my own gut reactions tend to match the
   current style of much Internet commentary, which is snarky and
   dismissive. That's why I try to exert as much control as possible over
   them. Sometimes, I fail.
   Last time was ten days ago. The New Republic's senior
   editor [264]Jonathan Cohn published [265]a story that included the
   following map:
   [266][1map1.png]
   There's no doubt that this is a really bad map. It provoked a lot of
   [267]laughs on Twitter, and a [268]thorough critique by Kenneth Field.
   It was even called “the worst map of the year.” But what I discovered
   during the [269]conversation on Twitter is that it's also the very
   first map [270]Cohn has made. They didn't have anyone to produce this
   kind of work in the newsroom at that moment, so Cohn got his data and
   visualized them with [271]Datawrapper. There's merit in that.
   Honestly, people, do you remember your first infographics or data
   visualizations? I do. They were horrible. I'll repeat that: Horrible.
   And they didn't get slightly better probably until three or four years
   after my career began. Fortunately, the World Wide Web wasn't as
   popular in 1997 as it is today, and social media wasn't even a topic in
   Science Fiction novels. Otherwise, my first efforts would probably had
   met the same responses Cohn received.
   Knowing myself a bit (or so I hope,) I guess that my reaction to
   criticism would be similar to Cohn's: Acknowledging the problem, and
   trying to fix it. In fact, Cohn redesigned his map, and added another
   with normalized data. See both maps below ([272]or in the story): Not
   bad, right? They are a zillion times better than the second graphic I
   produced as an intern in the late 1990s, that's for damn sure.
   [273][1newMaps.jpg]
   Where am I trying to go with this? Look, most of my students at the
   [274]University of Miami aren't going to be professional designers
   after they graduate. That isn't the assumption my courses are based on.
   My classes are intended to help students understand that anyone
   —writers, scientists, lawyers, you name it— is capable of communicating
   effectively by means of charts, maps, diagrams, and explanation
   illustrations, after learning some principles and software tricks.
   Scornful commentary of work done by beginners or non-designers is
   contrary to this goal of popularizing information graphics among the
   general public. Based on my experience, I can assure you that it
   discourages many newcomers. It makes them feel hopeless. It instills in
   them the sense that high-quality graphics should be the realm of a
   caste of information designers, computer scientists, cartographers,
   statisticians, etc. I loathe that notion because I loathe
   territoriality. I want this stuff to become mainstream. I wish to see
   amateurs taking risks, playing with software tools, failing, and
   learning from their mistakes, like Cohn did. Let's help them by never
   remaining silent when we see dubious graphics, but also by trying to be
   constructive.

[283]My first interactive visualization with Tableau

   Classes at the University of Miami begin two weeks from now, so I'm
   quite busy getting syllabi, lecture slides, and projects ready. Between
   the new [284]UM Visualization website and the [285]Places&Spaces
   exhibit and lecture series, I haven't been able to sit down and start
   planning for lessons until today. Oh, I've also been writing that book
   that should be published at the end of 2015, of course. More news about
   that soon, hopefully.
   This Fall semester I'm teaching a new version of my CVJ522 Infographics
   and Data Visualization grad course ([286]read an unedited draft of the
   syllabus,) in which I'll have students from both our [287]MFA in
   Interactive Media and [288]MA in Journalism programs. Therefore, I
   cannot just focus on news visualizations or print infographics.
   Instead, I decided to give students the opportunity to choose the tools
   and styles they prefer. Some of them will come to class knowing a bit
   of [289]Processing and even [290]d3.js, for instance.

[300]UM's new visualization website

   [301][1vis.png]
   [302]UM's visualization website
   As you may remember, [303]in January I was appointed as director of the
   visualization branch of the University of Miami's [304]Center for
   Computational Science. My main goal so far has been to find out what
   people in all departments at [305]UM are doing with visualization,
   information graphics, mapping, etc. It turns out it's an awful lot,
   which is exciting: I'll be able to help build many connections, and
   learn a big deal in the process.
   The second thing I've done is to create a new website in which, with
   the help of students and faculty, we'll announce events, projects,
   courses, etc. [306]I've soft-launched it already. Some sections aren't
   done yet, but there are a few stories available already.
   The most important one is[307] about the Places&Spaces visualization
   exhibit. We're bringing it to UM this Fall semester ([308]read the
   press release) and we've organized a series of talks by renowned people
   in the field, such as [309]Katy Börner, [310]Stephen Few, [311]Nigel
   Holmes, [312]John Grimwade, etc. You can attend these lectures for
   free, but you'll need to sign up through [313]the links in the story.
   We're also working on some very interesting new educational
   opportunities in data visualization and journalism. I cannot reveal
   anything for now, though. Stay tuned.

[322]Teaching visualization: A discussion

   Two days ago, [323]Katy Culver, [324]Susan McGregor, [325]Chrys Wu,
   [326]Hannah Fairfield, [327]Meredith Broussard, [328]Molly Steenson,
   and I participated in a Twitter discussion about how to teach
   visualization and infographics, with a particular focus in news
   graphics. The conversation was hosted by [329]PBS' Mediashift, and is
   [330]available in its entirety already.

                            [1edshift.com.png]
     I wonder where this picture comes from. The graphics displayed are
                              quite colorful!

[339]Thank you for a fun roundtable, Periscopic

   I've just landed from a trip to Portland. [340]Kennedy Elliott,
   [341]Sarah Slobin, [342]Scott Murray and I were invited
   by [343]Periscopic to participate in a roundtable, as part of
   their [344]their 10th anniversary celebrations. It was a lot of fun,
   and I even had some time to interview [345]Kim Rees and [346]Dino
   Citraro for my next book.
   The Periscopic crowd has just launched a new version of their
   [347]website/portfolio. Their work, as they say, is both art and
   science: [348]Emotional data visualization.
   Here's an accurate summary of our discussion. I'm sorry we couldn't be
   more helpful!

     Conclusion of yesterday’s panel at [349]@Periscopic: we know
     nothing, there are no definitive answers, and we wish we had better
     answers.

[363]Gorgeous infographics from Fortune magazine (March 1938 issue)

   [364][5.jpg]
   Map by Richard Edes Harrison for Fortune (March 1938)
   Last month I went to [365]Steven Heller's moving sale in NYC with
   [366]Scott Klein, [367]Eric Sagara, and [368]Kaiser Fung. I was not
   planning to buy anything but, unfortunately (for my wallet),
   [369]Heller was selling several issues of [370]Fortune magazine from
   the 30s, 40s, and 50s. I walked out with 12 under my arm. That wasn't a
   trivial feat, as each old Fortune is as big as a tabloid newspaper and
   as thick and heavy as a hardcover book. Good workout!
   It's impossible to talk about the history of news graphics and
   visualization without mentioning Fortune. A simple Google search
   ("fortune infographics”) will reveal several posts and articles that
   collect beautiful examples: [371]1, [372]2, [373]3, [374]4. However,
   let me assure you that it's not the same to see those graphics on a
   computer screen than to hold them on your hands, printed on
   high-quality paper. They are glorious.
   It's taking me hours to go over each of the issues I got, so for now
   I'll just show you a few pictures from the March 1938 one.
