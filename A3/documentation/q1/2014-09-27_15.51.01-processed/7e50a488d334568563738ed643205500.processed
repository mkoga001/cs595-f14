[5]Friday Randoms

   I may suck at running but I have an awesome buff collection. I think
   that's going to be my new mantra.
   This week I finally set up my Garmin Connect account. Gosh, what took
   me so long? Yup, it's been that kind of year. It really is a great tool
   for tracking progress. It would have been great to see what I
   accomplished in 2014 but I mistakenly deleted the entire history on my
   Garmin. Did I also mention that I have been daydreaming lately? Sigh.
   Oh well that means I can start my running career anew! I can just erase
   all my bad runs this year. Ha.
   [blogger-image-596033867.jpg]
   Seriously I am excited about linking my info on a database that I can
   check on my Macbook or on my iPhone. It's always great to have
   something new to obsess over. So far, I have put in two runs this week.
   They weren't really "training" runs but just get the hell out there
   runs. I took Yvonne and Steve out for an easy 12K on Wednesday and last
   night I tested my ankle with a hilly 5K. It didn't go that well and I
   ended up walking quite a bit.
   On top of all that I did something to my right shoulder. No it is not
   crossfit related. I have no clue what I did. Anyway I am on the mend
   but I have not been able to do any sort of lifting or pull up movements
   this week. I have had to modify my workouts. Hello lunges.
   But that did not stop me from being a maniac and away from the pool. I
   have slowly gotten into the habit of swimming at least once a week
   again. Not sure how it happened but that's where I am at. I went
   tonight solo. Renee came with me last week. I hope she comes again. We
   had fun catching up between laps.
   There wasn't many people in the pool so I had a lane to myself. Score.
   This almost never happens. I probably should have swam to my heart's
   content but I wanted to be home by 10 p.m. I have crossfit at 6 a.m.
   and I didn't want to get to bed too late.

   [blogger-image--1634092196.jpg]
   Yeah so that has been my week. Not much but work & trying to get back
   into the run of things. I am counting down the days until my holiday. I
   have two weeks off in October. Not sure where I am going or what I am
   doing. My passport is in plain view. So who knows where I will end up.
   Happy Friday!

[16]Community Garden: All things must come to an end

   Oh my glorious garden. What an unexpected success. I didn't expect the
   veggies to grow so well. Naysayers and seasoned green thumbs filled my
   head with noise about the difficulties of growing in a short Alberta
   growing season. But oh did I prove them wrong.
   [blogger-image-1090784095.jpg]   [blogger-image-1813308007.jpg]
   I lucked out because Renee wanted to share a community garden plot with
   me. I always get a little freaked out and anxious when I try something
   new so I am glad she didn't laugh at my silly questions. (Seriously
   people can be mean!). We divided our plot in half. And off we went in
   our separate growing directions.
   [blogger-image-857674460.jpg]   [blogger-image-1150918839.jpg]
   I am all about the leafy greens so I planted swiss chard, spinach, and
   leaf lettuce. Carrots and beets were only root vegetables. I think next
   year I will try potatoes. If you have been reading my blog, you will
   know my spinach bolted before I had time to pick it all. That was my
   one big suck. Other than that misstep everything grew smoothly!
   [blogger-image--35528359.jpg]
   Everyone asked me about the weeding. What weeding? Truth be told, I
   spent less than 2 hours in total weeding since May. Imagine that! I
   have magic weeding powers! It must have been karma after all those
   summers having to weed the family gardens.
   [blogger-image-1232250516.jpg]  [17] [blogger-image--1401303319.jpg]
   All my leafy greens went quickly into daily smoothies and into my
   coworkers' fridges. I made dill pickles and pickled carrots with my
   bounty. Score another point because I have never tried this before!
   (Still a little nervous about cracking open the jars.)
   [blogger-image--400200088.jpg]
   Next year I want to try different veggies! It's going to suck having to
   go back to buying from the supermarket. I tried to freeze as much as I
   could but I am not very good at using frozen food.
   I found much joy in my little garden. It was very rewarding to toss a
   bunch of seeds in the ground then watch them grow. As a plant-based
   eater, I love growing my own food and eating as close to the ground as
   possible.
   I just wish Alberta had a longer growing season! (It would also be nice
   to have more fruit options.)

[29]It's review time: Manitoba Harvest's Hemp Pro70

   I am not a professional reviewer. In fact, I only "review" products
   that I could really see myself using after the trial period. You see as
   a proud plant-eater for the last 20 years, I am very conscious of what
   I put into my body. I try to eat as close to the ground as possible and
   avoid all that processed crap.
   I jumped at the chance to review Manitoba Harvest's new [30]Hemp Pro70
   in vanilla and chocolate flavours. I was invited to test the
   product because I am a proud [31]Sweat Pink ambassador.
   I have a big love for Manitoba Harvest's [32]hemp hearts. They taste
   amazing on fruit. I've been looking for a new solid plant-based protein
   to add to my diet. I've been using a few random brands. Maybe this
   could be what I have been searching for?
   [blogger-image--950864829.jpg]
   GoGreen smoothie: Water + pineapple + banana + kale + [33]Vanilla Hemp
   Pro70
   You know I am all about the green smoothies. I have one everyday that
   goes a little something like this: water + fruit + greens. I added the
   vanilla flavour protein to my morning smoothie.
   It looked good (all green does really) and it tasted awesome. I
   detected just a hint of vanilla. I think the pineapple and vanilla
   together made a good match. There was no aftertaste or any of that yuck
   that some plant-based proteins leave behind.
   [blogger-image--151808923.jpg]
   For the chocolate flavour, I wanted to keep it simple. The package says
   the protein is 100 per cent completely water soluble. (Meaning you
   don't need a blender to mix it up). I wanted to see if this was legit.
   I mixed a couple of unsweeted Almond milk and the chocolate protein in
   one of my shakers. (I resisted the urge to flip on my beloved Vitamix)
   You know what? It was super light, creamy and smooth. (I drank it as a
   recovery drink after a long run.) I don't think using my Vitamix would
   have made a difference.
   THE LOWDOWN
     * Pure plant-based protein
     * Only four ingredients in either flavour (hemp protein concentrate,
       organic coconut sugar, organic fair trade cocoa powder, natural
       plant extracts)
     *  Water soluble, vegan, vegetarian
     * Low on the glycemic index
     * You don't have to have a smoothie to enjoy the protein. The
       Manitoba Harvest website boasts a large [34]recipe database. Make
       everything from cookies, soups, salads, dressings and spreads using
       the hemp pro70.
     * 14 grams of protein in chocolate and 15 grams in vanilla
     * Canadian made

   THE VERDICT
   I'm sold. The two flavours worked for me. I loved that the vanilla and
   chocolate worked well in my everyday. Like I said before some proteins
   can be a real challenge to stomach. Nice to see a Canadian company do
   so well too!
