   I was at a 5sos fam meetup recently and everyone sucked and thought
   they were punkrock because they yelled suck my ass to strangers and I
   got really disappointed bc a lot of people have talked about how they
   had made new friends bc of 5sosfam but these made me question if I

   I've only been a fan since May and I feel like the older fans don't
   like me bc in new. I get that it's hard bc the boys are getting bigger.
   Like ok how that feels but I'm only here for the music. Not there
   looks.
