[9]How to have adult braces

   Almost exactly seven months ago, I wrote a post about my [10]decision
   to get adult braces. In the months between then and now, my teeth, lips
   and jaw – my face in general – have endured a considerable amount of
   aggro: teeth shifting in my skull, wires cutting into my cheeks, lips
   drier than the Sahara no matter how much Vaseline I slapped on them –
   not to mention the inevitable skin capillary damage incurred from the
   routine face-reddening that followed the discovery of small forests of
   salad protruding from my mechanical smile.

   Pain. Expense. Humiliation. But was it worth it? Yes. Absolutely,
   unequivocally, yes. I feel more confident about my smile, it’s much
   easier to clean my teeth, my recurring jaw pain has lessened as my bite
   has straightened out, and as a lovely bonus, I feel a kind of pride
   about the whole thing – not in my appearance necessarily, but the fact
   that I worked hard and endured a lot of discomfort and rigmarole to
   change something I didn’t like. Empowerment, if you will. (Of course,
   there were numerous days when I would find it all so tedious and
   difficult that I felt like taking pliers to my gob and just ending it
   there and then.)

   I’ve had lots of questions about the process, and about my own
   experience of having adult braces, so sit back and enjoy as I harp on
   knowledgably…

   My teeth at the start, getting mad-cosy with each other up in there

   Choosing a dentist

   I cannot stress enough how important it is to do your research, here.
   There are hundreds of cosmetic dentistry practices out there offering
   ‘straighter smiles’, and while the actual technology is largely the
   same across the board, what really makes the difference is the level of
   time, care and trust you receive. You’re essentially putting your
   physical wellbeing in the hands of somebody else, and choosing a
   dentist based purely on price or proximity means you could be setting
   yourself up for a very miserable few months – or longer. Pay attention
   to online reviews and go to free consultations to make sure you’re
   comfortable with the place you choose. I went for a consultation at a
   clinic in Harley Street – thinking that its prestigious location would
   guarantee quality – and left vowing never to return after the staff
   spent little time talking about my needs and a lot of time talking
   about payment plans. In the end I chose [12]UltraSmile, and I’m so glad
   I did, even if their Limehouse location was a total ballache for me in
   Tooting.
   [13]And they're on

   And they’re on

   What type of braces?

   ‘Dental alignment technology’ (ha) has come a long way since I first
   had metal train tracks as a teenager (which are actually still
   available). Nowadays, it’s usually a toss-up between [14]Invisalign and
   [15]Six Month Smiles (although as I discovered you can get totally
   bitching gold – yes, GOLD – braces fitted behind your teeth for like, a
   million pounds or something). I’m not qualified to really comment on
   Invisalign, although I am currently using it for retainer purposes
   (more on that, later), as I opted for Six Month Smiles (SMS). SMS is
   essentially a train track technology, but the brackets and wire are
   tooth-coloured, so it’s not so obvious (unless you drink orange juice
   or eat a curry. More on that later, too). I chose this one because it
   promised quicker results and less faff than Invisalign.

   How much does it cost?

   Costs will vary depending on the type of braces you choose, your clinic
   and whether they’re offering any deals (almost all of them are at some
   point). My complete treatment cost £2,795 including retainers (these
   are vital, and a lot of clinics will try to charge you extra for them).
   Ultrasmile gave me the option to pay half up front, and the rest in
   interest-free monthly instalments over four, six or ten months. It
   wasn’t the cheapest deal I’d seen, but I was happy with the clinic and
   the staff – it certainly wasn’t the most expensive, either.

   What happens first?

   Before I had the braces fitted I had to have a thorough check-up, an
   appointment with the hygienist and a set of x-rays done. This was to
   make sure my teeth were in good nick before I imprisoned them in
   plastic for six months (getting a filling or having a scale and polish
   with braces is basically impossible). Once I had the all-clear the
   dentist took an impression of my teeth, which involved having my mouth
   packed with gummy plaster and sitting quietly for 15 minutes waiting
   for it to dry, all the while dribbling and gagging like a moron.

   The braces were fitted at my next appointment. I won’t go into a huge
   amount of detail here because the process is pretty stressful and I
   don’t want to put anyone off. Because my main problem is overcrowding
   the dentist had to file in between my teeth first (sounds worse than it
   is), before gently scraping the front of each tooth a little to create
   a bit of ‘grip’ for the brackets, which were then cemented on using
   some high-tech jiggery-pokery. A wire was then placed in the grooves in
   the brackets, and secured with little clear plastic bands. The wires
   were then trimmed down at the ends, so as ‘not to cause discomfort’
   (that’s the theory) and I was on my way.
   [16]One month in

   One month in

   Does having braces hurt?

   Yes. Yes, it bloody does. The first few days after having them put on
   were horrendous and I honestly rued the day I’d ever even considered
   the treatment. But of course it’s going to be painful. Your teeth –
   otherwise happy and content in their position in your skull – are being
   pushed, pulled and dragged around your jaw bone, and the soft skin of
   your lips and inside of your mouth suddenly has to contend with jagged
   bits of plastic and metal jabbing into it. The first few days are
   nothing short of miserable.

   Here are some things you can’t do (particularly well) with freshly
   applied braces:
     * Eat anything that isn’t pureed into mush
     * Smile
     * Talk properly
     * Wash and dry your face
     * Lie on your face
     * Wear lipstick
     * Chew absentmindedly on a pen
     * Use your teeth to separate a kirby grip (something you can’t do for
       the duration unfortunately – trust me, I tried)
     * Enjoy a cigarette
     * Do kissing
     * Various sexy activities

   I made the colossally stupid error of planning a fancy dinner out the
   day after I had mine put on. “I’m sure it won’t be that bad,” I
   reasoned, like an idiot. It was. I spent the whole time staring sadly
   at my delicious steak, as it became increasingly salted by my tears of
   pain and sadness.

   But! The pain and discomfort doesn’t last forever. I promise. I was
   given a load of dental wax to coat rough bits of plastic and wire, and
   the ol’ alternate paracetamol/Ibuprofen system helps. I’d also say that
   Anbesol works a lot better than Bonjela, which just tends to slide over
   gums (thanks to Hayley and her teething tot for that recommendation).

   After the first few days the pain subsided and I was left with a very
   vague – and tolerable – aching. The braces do need to be tightened
   every month or so which is also painful, but it’s nothing at all like
   the first time. Soon enough I’d stopped noticing them altogether.

   It is worth noting, though, that I could go for days on end without any
   pain or discomfort at all and then one day I’d wake up and one
   particular tooth or group of teeth would be sore. Annoying, but that
   just meant the braces were doing their thing.
   [17]Three months in

   Three months in

   How do you look after them?

   It’s a lot harder to give your teeth a good clean when they’re covered
   in scaffolding, so brushing took on a new, laborious dynamic. Top notch
   hygiene is important for two reasons: 1) It’s easy for plaque to build
   up around the brackets and cause cavities, and 2) When the brackets
   come off it’s not uncommon for there to be a lot of weird and
   unattractive staining where they used to be. Traditional flossing was
   out (not that, I admit, I was particularly devout about flossing in the
   first place), so I was told to use those little [18]pipe cleaner sticks
   instead. For someone who never flossed regularly, this was a bit of an
   assault on my gums, but they were useful for removing all the bits of
   trapped food that would otherwise drive me nuts. (I kept one in my bag
   at all times for covert trips to the bathroom when I was eating out).
   Also, don’t use whitening products (even ones that claim to work but
   don’t actually do anything), because that can lead to weird
   discolouration when the brackets come off, too.

   Even though SMS is billed as being ‘nearly invisible’, the clear bands
   around the brackets are liable to staining. “Avoid anything that would
   stain a shirt”, my dentist told me, which I did with due care (apart
   from the time I drank orange juice and was left with what looked like a
   neon glowstick in my gob. See below). Nonetheless, come every
   adjustment appointment they were looking a bit grubby. It probably
   didn’t help that I’m a filthy smoker, of course. (FYI – chewing gum is
   out when you have fixed braces, but there are loads of
   breath-freshening sprays that do the job in banishing faggy breath).

   Finally, my lips took more of a battering than I’d anticipated, and
   keeping them moisturised and chap-free was a struggle. I bought a load
   of lipsalves and put them everywhere – the lounge, the kitchen, in all
   my bags and coat pockets – so there was always one to hand. I also got
   into the habit of slapping a load of[19] this on before bed.

   The braces are pretty tough and are designed to withstand a lot of
   force, but it’s not uncommon for brackets to ping off if they’re put
   under too much stress. So harder food (apples, beloved Toblerones),
   sticky stuff (toffee, caramel) and gritty snacks (popcorn, seeds)
   should be given a miss. I didn’t find this too much of a sacrifice, but
   the one thing that really bummed me out was turning down Nandos’ corn
   on the cob. I bloody love Nandos’ corn on the cob.
   [20]Thanks, orange juice!

   Thanks, orange juice!

   Did you feel like a dick wearing adult braces?

   Nope, not really. Although the day I had them put on I went to
   Superdrug for supplies and the guy behind the counter was looking at
   the dental wax in my basket. He asked what it was for and I pointed to
   my mouth and he looked so embarrassed and apologetic. So I guess there
   is a bit of a stigma around it. Most people, I found, were pretty
   inquisitive about the process, and I heard “I’ve been thinking about
   doing the same” at least 20 times. The main issue I encountered was
   with bits of rogue food getting stuck in them, yapping away happily to
   people and not realising until later – a lot of people seemed reluctant
   to tell me I had whole lettuce leaves hanging out of my mouth (artistic
   license) for fear of offending me. But that’s where the shiny surface
   of smartphones comes in handy – it’s very easy to do a covert check.

   I actually quite enjoyed flaunting my braces. They made me feel a bit
   unique and, like I said, empowered. (Plus they gave me a super pouty
   smile).

   When did you decide to have them taken off?

   There’s no obvious ‘end point’ with SMS. It’s pretty good at sorting
   out gaps and overcrowding, but it won’t change the shape of your teeth
   or do any major jaw reconstruction (for example, I still have an
   overbite, and I always will unless I opt to have my jaw broken and
   realigned – nope). They call it Six Month Smiles because that’s the
   average length of time it takes for patients to decide they’re happy
   with the results. I was pretty lucky that I had “malleable arches”
   (yay?), so my teeth moved quickly and I was done in less than five
   months, but for some it’s longer. Personally, I could’ve kept them on
   for a little longer to tweak one or two tiny areas, but it was coming
   up to Christmas and I didn’t want to go into the New Year with them on,
   so off they came.

   Having them taken off is a bit more traumatic than having them put on
   (after all, they’re cemented to your teeth), but the payoff is that
   you’re going to have a lovely new smile at the end of it.

   Is that it?

   ‘Fraid not. The reason my teeth were in such a mess was because I never
   wore my retainer the first time around, so they just shifted back to
   their original position. Teeth will do that, unfortunately. After the
   braces came off I had more gummy, gag-inducing moulds taken to create a
   single Invisalign brace, which I now use as a retainer, currently
   wearing it mostly full-time for four to six months, then only at night.
   It’s a bit of a faff, to be honest, but I know wearing it is important
   – when I go out in the evenings I tend to leave it at home and when I
   finally get around to putting it back in I can feel my teeth have
   already started shifting slightly.
   [21]My Invisalign retainer

   My Invisalign retainer

   I’ve also had a permanent, fixed retainer fitted (can’t get a camera in
   my mouth to take a picture, looks [22]like this). At first I was a bit
   disheartened at the prospect of having yet more stuff in my mouth, but
   I’ve quickly gotten used to it, and it doesn’t cause anywhere near the
   same problems as the actual brace did (although one tooth did come
   unbonded the other day, which warranted a tedious trek back to the
   clinic – so that does happen). I’ll likely have this one on for around
   four to five years.

   But I’m okay with that *beams*.

[33]A few thoughts on turning 29

   Today I turn 29. Another year none the wiser.

   And despite well-meaning words from my mother and a Twitter community
   of superb women who don’t give a toss about ‘The Big 3-0’, there exists
   on my radar an unrelenting stream of popular culture that really does
   like to make a big fucking deal about it: ‘listicles’ divisively,
   hilariously, separating those in their 20s from those in their 30s;
   landslides of journalism banging on about declining fertility and
   average home-buying ages; a quiet consensus that 30 signifies the
   getting together of one’s shit. So despite my relative unconcern about
   being older, per se, I am dazzled by the unavoidable 30 up ahead,
   flashing vulgarly like a fairground ride.

   And in a way I just wish I was there already, because once I am,
   there’s no going back. Sure, as an act of defiance I could get a load
   of botox done, or take off to India for three months, or drink myself
   into oblivion in a student bar, but even my extensive drinking skills
   are no match for the march of time. It will be as it will be.

   Here, though, at 29, there’s very much the sense of a great, ominous
   foreboding, inescapable for the reasons detailed above. Some sense that
   I still have a tiny window of opportunity to ‘do something’. Not
   because being 30+ heralds the end of life – far from it – but because
   our society has put so much emphasis on this landmark age. Before and
   after.

    Of course, the problem here is that I don’t actually know what that
   something is. How many 29-year-olds do? This question itself is part of
   the problem.

   Being 29 is like the moment before you step on a plane, or strap
   yourself into a rollercoaster. It’s the second before you apply the
   wax, or before you must relinquish the flash cards and go into an exam.
   It’s the breath before you say ‘I love you’ or ‘It’s over’. Because
   once you’ve committed to these things – said the words or smeared the
   hot goo on your legs – that’s that. You’ve just gotta make peace with
   it. But in that gut-churningly pressurised instant beforehand, there’s
   still the chance, the opportunity, to do something differently.

   But what?

[42]Six apparently ‘normal’ behaviours I’ll never understand

   People that listen to talk radio at an above-normal volume

   Music is good loud. I get that, I get that it’s designed to be an
   immersive experience, and that at the end of a shitty day it’s pretty
   cathartic to turn Pink’s ‘Try, Try, Try’ up to 11 and belt out all the
   bad feels, but I don’t understand why people listen to predominantly
   chat-based radio shows at an ear-splitting volume. It’s just people
   talking. Is the experience of listening to people talking more
   enjoyable when it feels like they’re actually shouting at you? Or does
   it just in fact piss off your neighbours or housemates or anyone
   walking past your car who doesn’t derive any enjoyment from hearing Ted
   from Basingstoke talk about his opinions on hot-housing at a booming
   sound level?

   Barmen who ask if I ‘mean diet coke’

   If you go into a shop and ask for a can of blue paint and the assistant
   says ‘Is that blue paint or red paint?’ then you’d give them an odd
   look. And if they held your stare while gesticulating impatiently at
   all the paint, you’d probably just back away slowly. So why is it
   acceptable for a barman to ask me ‘Is that coke or diet coke?’ when
   I’ve clearly asked for a coke? IF I WANT DIET COKE, I’LL ASK FOR DIET
   COKE. This situation is made much worse when they use the term ‘full
   fat’. Watch it, buddy.

   Being weird about food stuck in teeth

   If you go into the office and your colleague has got a bit of fluff on
   their face, you’d be like ‘Dude, there’s something on your face’, and
   they’d remove the fluff, and everyone would get on with their lives.
   But when that fluff is food and the face is teeth, people get super
   weird about it, thus resulting in many hapless individuals spending
   their days talking, laughing and smiling in front of people that are
   like ‘Ugh, gross’, before going home to a mirror and deep
   embarrassment. I currently have braces which makes this a really major
   problem, but even though I’ve explicitly told those around me that they
   should just say if I have something stuck in my teeth, I still find
   myself revealing forests of salad every time I do a quick cursory check
   after lunch. So to better align my behaviour with others’, next time an
   angry wasp lands on a friend’s head I’ll just be like ‘Oh yeah, erm,
   sorry. Didn’t see it *mumble mumble*’.

   The total futility of ‘tasting the wine’

   In the olden days, patrons of hospitality establishments were offered a
   small sample from a newly-opened bottle of wine to check that it wasn’t
   corked. Nowadays, the majority of wine served in restaurants comes in
   screw-top bottles, so the entire exercise serves no purpose other than
   to make customers feel uncomfortable as a relative stranger watches
   them imbibe a tiny bee-mouth’s worth of liquid before declaring ‘Yes,
   lovely thanks’, even if it tastes like expired milk.

   Small children on the rush-hour underground

   Children need to learn to walk, and they need to learn to socialise. Is
   the underground at rush hour the best place for that? IS IT? Is the
   best place to put your toddling offspring in front of hundreds of
   tired, irritable commuters storming from one platform to another each
   with flailing bags and briefcases in perfect alignment with your
   child’s soft bonce? Is the best time to ‘practice stairs’ at 6pm on a
   Monday evening when said staircase is full of gnarling office workers
   chomping at the bit to get on the tube before it becomes so rammed they
   have to spend the journey home pressed into the greasy, finger-smeared
   doors? Is it?

   Women peeing on the toilet seat

   Nothing makes me so seriously consider abandoning the sisterhood than
   walking into a toilet cubicle and finding pee all over the seat. What
   is HAPPENING in there? Maybe you’re a hoverer, fair enough. But if your
   distaste of public conveniences is such that you’d perch uncomfortably
   over the toilet to avoid making contact with it, then surely you’re
   aware that leaving the vicinity in such a state makes you just as
   culpable as those you fear yourself. SORT IT OUT, YOU’RE GROSS.

[52]How to find a house in London

   Start your search early. Far too early. Take a cursory look at Gumtree
   and Spareroom and find loads of properties that match your reasonable
   requirements. Confidence level: 100%.

   Then start your search for real. Find all the good places have gone,
   but that’s okay, because there’s still time. There’s still time to be
   choosy. Laugh scornfully at adverts boasting ‘Lovely and good’ or
   ‘Cheap and nice’ rooms. We all know what that means. You’ve got
   standards, thanks very much. Confidence level: 90%.

   Go to a few viewings. Find that the rooms are not anywhere near as
   ‘gorgeous’ or ‘spacious’ or even as ‘good-sized’ as the ad description
   suggests, but that’s okay! It would be unheard of to find somewhere
   decent straight away, right? It’s London! Confidence level: 80%.

   Go to more viewings. View several houses with palatial ensuites that
   can only be accessed through a partially open door as the adjoining
   bedroom is a cupboard. View a house occupied by pasty, translucent boys
   that all but wet themselves shaking your hand and ask if you have many
   single girl friends. View a house with giant pictures of vaginas all
   over the walls and be scolded by the landlord for looking at them. View
   a house where the available room is advertised as having its own
   conservatory but find that it’s basically a lean-to featuring a clogged
   toilet. View a house where the door is opened by an imposingly large
   Turkish man who yells ‘YOU A CLEAN GIRL, OKAY?’ in your face.
   Confidence level: 50%.

   Eventually, find a place you really like. Text the tenants to express
   interest. Hours, then days, pass without a reply. Become wracked with
   self-doubt as your self-esteem takes a battering. Maybe you came on too
   strong. Maybe your joke about baking a chocolate cake was interpreted
   as needy, or mental, even. WHAT’S THE BLOODY ETIQUETTE FOR THIS SHIT?
   Struggle with the idea that the tenants have put you in the same league
   as sweaty hands boy, or mad vagina lady.

   Spend hours and hours on room share sites. Destroy your phone battery
   by hitting refresh every five minutes. Send hundreds of awkward ‘I’m
   super cool and normal!’ emails to people who never respond. Find dozens
   of gorgeous houseshares advertised by awesome-sounding people
   requesting gay applicants only. Damn the gays and their beautiful
   mould-free houses.

   Manage your expectations. Broaden your search parameters. You don’t
   really need a garden. You don’t really need a living room. Sure, you
   can work from your bed, and it’ll be fine sharing with four couples.
   Fun, even! Confidence level: 30%.

   Lament your woes to your friends and listen to them wax lyrical about
   how hard they found that one week they spent searching for a flat, or
   how they had to view ‘like, six or seven!’ places before they found
   their current house, or how it actually took them upwards of two months
   to find somewhere because the lettings market in London is completely
   fucked and they’re not telling you this to dishearten you, but ‘you
   know…’.

   And you do know. You ‘know’ to the point that you’ve started viewing
   rooms that have been advertised without pictures and wishing some kind
   of property [53]Lemon Law existed so you didn’t have to spend whole
   hours traipsing around an inhabitable dive answering questions about
   what you do for a living and listening to fucking News of the World
   jokes. You ‘know’ to the point that you’re starting to think that an
   advert mentioning the fact that the room’s radiators have valves is
   probably pretty useful to know actually, and you ‘know’ to the point
   that you’re seriously considering responding to the likes of these
   ‘Cheap and lovely’ adverts you’d previously pooh-poohed.
   [54]Looks nice.

   Looks nice.
   [55]It would have taken exactly 30 seconds to clear that crap off the
   bed.

   I can’t even.

   Confidence level: 5%

   And then one morning, three and a half months and 23 viewings later,
   sit in the bedroom you’ve come to hate and load up Gumtree for the
   millionth time, and find a new advert. A new advert with pictures, and
   an adequate description written by people that sound sane, and go into
   your message drafts and copy/paste the same tired message you’ve looked
   at five times a day for the last 117 days. Send it off. Expect nothing.
   Don’t even allow the smallest sliver of hope or optimism into the dark,
   rough void where your soul used to be, for only disappointment resides
   there now.

   Receive a reply straight away. Go through the motions, arrange a
   viewing. Plaster a smile over your tired, lifeless face and trudge to
   the address. Ring the bell and take a deep breath as the door opens…

   Confidence level: 100%.
   [61]Ta-dah!

   Ta-dah!

[73]Brace Face. In London.

   [74]Six Month Smile for adults ‘Kids can be so cruel’.

   I hate that expression, namely because usually the people that throw it
   around with reckless gay abandon, chuckling and rolling their eyes as
   they do, were the very kids propagating the cruelty. I find that those
   that were on the receiving end tend to keep their mouths shut, pushing
   their unpleasant memories into an untapped pocket of their mind where
   it can all fester quietly as a mental illness.

   Still. Kids can be horrendous creatures, and it only takes one
   knuckle-dragging child to come up with an insulting nickname that’ll
   plague you for the rest of your days. Something the rest of the drones
   will latch on to and throw like spears in a bid to avoid their own
   persecution. Child psychology 101.

   The problem is, once you’ve grown up and gotten your shit together, and
   have long since revelled in seeing the offenders clocking off at
   McDonald’s, or waddling down the high street with a farm of children
   nipping at their heels, that nickname still scratches around the
   corners of your consciousness. It embeds itself in your psyche, and
   becomes a quiet part of your identity.

   Even if you no longer demonstrate attributes of the name, the name was
   once responsible for the shape of your entire world. Despite the ‘love
   yourself!’ rhetoric that dominates much of the conversation we’re party
   to nowadays, where self-acceptance and self-assurance are the ultimate
   goals, your heart will still miss a beat when you hear the name
   mentioned (entirely out of context, of course), or are in on any kind
   of discussion revolving around features linked to the name. Like it or
   not, that bloody name is an albatross around your neck no matter how
   many inspirational ‘U R so unique’ quotes you read on Tumblr.

   Which is partly why, at the age of 28, I’m getting braces.

   Again.

   I had braces when I was 15 in a bid to counteract the attributes of the
   name which had long before been bestowed unto me. The requisite train
   track types that marked a rite of passage for the dentally
   disadvantaged teenager, but were liable to rip open the inside of your
   cheeks and drive pieces of errant metal wire into your gums every time
   you attempted an apple or a Mars Bar. But so desperate was I to be rid
   of them, and the name, that the retainer given to me by the
   orthodontist once they’d come off was gleefully flung into a drawer and
   quickly forgotten about. It was only a few weeks afterwards that I
   tried to put it back on and realised that my teeth had already moved
   too far to do so. Good work, teenage me.

   So the name stuck, and I have been hugely paranoid about my teeth ever
   since, especially since they have now shifted quite significantly back
   into their original, overcrowded position.

   The few people I’ve spoken to about this have of course assured me that
   my teeth are fine. And I know they’re not that bad, really. But this
   has nothing to do with emulating magazine-standard beauty or
   aspirational living, it’s because every time I look in the mirror, see
   a photograph of myself smiling awkwardly, or even see my erratic,
   jumbled bite mark in a piece of fruit, the name reverberates around my
   skull like a trapped bird, along with all the anxiety, paranoia and
   nervousness associated with it. So I’m taking charge of the name by
   banishing it for good.

   The irony is that I’ve spent all of my adult life trying to hide my
   teeth, and now I’m drawing attention to them in the most overt way
   possible: “I’m an adult with braces! I’m unhappy with my teeth! Look at
   them!” It’s something that makes me feel quite sick and uneasy, but if
   I don’t do this now, then when? I definitely don’t want to make it to
   old age and look back at photos of milestone moments and think ‘Fuck, I
   wish I’d just gotten it over with’.

   So after nearly eight years of saving (son, this shit is expensive and
   I’m a freelancer), I’m off to purposefully regress into my teenage
   self, and exorcise her of the demons of the name.

   Just gonna get my fill of apples and Mars Bars first.

[83]‘Should’ is a four letter word

   [84]Is 30 the new 20? This morning I watched a TED video joyfully
   titled ‘[85]Why 30 is not the new 20’. In it, clinical psychologist Meg
   Jay talks about the plight of indecision and nonchalance afflicting
   huge swathes of 20-somethings around the world – 20-somethings that
   live their lives in a comforting bubble of ‘I’m young, I’ve got time,
   I’ll do it tomorrow’.

   That such 20-somethings then wake up at 30 lamenting those lost years,
   panic-marrying and diving blindly into any old career because they
   spent too long ‘seeing what would happen’, is not, Meg says, okay. And
   she’s right. But as rousing as that speech is for 20-somethings that do
   still have time on their hands, for those hurtling towards the big 3-0,
   it’s a hell of a kick in the face. And thus…

   [86]Meg

   This bloody video comes at a sarcastically-relevant time for me,
   because like the case studies discussed, I too am beginning to feel the
   panicky sensation of life speeding up, when right now I just need it to
   calm the hell down so I can figure out what I’m doing. And at the crux
   of the problem (my ‘identity crisis’?) is a single word. Should.

   Last night I read that the Independent’s new editor – Amol Rajan – is
   29-years-old. By comparison, I should be much farther along in my
   career than I am now. Of course, there’s little point in making
   comparisons, but it’s given me cause to consider the job I do. Should I
   be doing something differently? Should I consider a different
   direction? Should I accept that freelance journalism is not a
   sustainable way of life and get an office job? Where should I start?
   Should, should, should.

   Then, and perhaps more distressingly, is the fact that some 95% of my
   female friends have shacked up with their other halves (and given this
   blog’s readership there’s a very high chance you’re one of them).
   Again, I am rational enough to recognise that there’s no basis for
   comparison, but it makes me consider what I should be doing. My bloke
   and I are very happy living separately, but should we be living
   together? And if not now, then when should we consider it? And if we’re
   not living together by now should we be asking why not? Again with the
   shoulds.

   The word pours into every aspect of imminent-30s life in a very toxic
   way. The ‘shoulds’ that presented themselves in my early and mid-20s
   were concrete and finite, with clear outcomes and consequences rendered
   irrelevant by the wonderfully intangible sands of time that lay beneath
   every question.

   Now, the ‘shoulds’ are abstract, the outcomes uncertain and it’s the
   consequences that are concrete. Many (myself included) live in constant
   states of happy/unhappy: ‘I’m happy with my life, but should (there’s
   that word again) I be happier?’ Or, perhaps more damagingly: ‘I’m not
   happy with my life, what should I be doing to be happier?’ And for
   guidance, they look to others:

                   ‘What is the control group doing?’

   And if you’re not doing what the control group is doing then it’s very
   easy to feel like you’re trapped behind a pane of glass, watching
   everyone else skip merrily along with their lives. There’s momentum in
   you, but you’re not going anywhere, and the whole thing is worsened by
   the media reports and scare stories and blimmin’ TED videos promising
   definite misery if particular life objectives are not met within
   certain timeframes.

   It’s time to ditch the word ‘should’.

   ‘Should’ is inherently doubtful. ‘Should’ is inherently indecisive.
   ‘Should’ paves the way for ‘maybes’ and ‘perhaps’. It’s kinda negative,
   really.

   So forget ‘should’. Replace it with ‘will’, and ‘can’, both positive,
   hopeful and empowering words free of uncertainty: “What will I do…?”
   “What can I do…?” After all, Obama didn’t emerge victorious on the back
   of ‘Yes we should’, did he?

   It’s no mean feat to entirely change the way you think about life –
   after all, we’re all subjected to damning ‘Big 3-0’ narratives for
   years and years before we actually get there, but it’s your choice as
   to whether you keep listening to them. It’s within your power, and the
   power of ‘can’ and ‘will’. Let those words pour through imminent-30s
   life. The only alternative to doing so is the ‘shoulds’ and the
   debilitating whispers of the control group, but if you’ve read this
   far, it means you’re already pretty sick of those.

   Thirty is not the new twenty, no. It’s not the new anything. But it has
   come to represent some kind of invisible cut off point for joining the
   control group, or for doing the things you really think you should do.

   But it’s not a question of whether you should. It’s whether you will.

[96]A picture of teenage depression

   [97]Pills For a number of reasons, this week has seen my hasty and
   unexpected return to the ‘Shire for a couple of days. As anyone who has
   ever spent more than ten minutes in my conversational company will
   know, there’s not a lot to do here. I’ve looked at Dad’s new lettuce
   patch, watched a high volume of crappy chick-flicks and had a
   [98]weirdly spooky moment with my mum while the dog ate a tea towel.
   And that’s about as much as I could hope for, activity-wise.

   So, in a move that was guaranteed to end well, I decided to dig out all
   the boxes of sentimental teenage stuff that I had accumulated over the
   years. Diaries, knick-knacks, letters, an astonishing number of
   decorative fans (why), and quite a lot of crap with meaning I can no
   longer recall. That sort of thing.

   And it made me really, really sad (quelle surprise), because for the
   first time in my adult life I sat down and read – through my many
   diaries – a blow-by-blow account of the mental health issues I
   struggled with when I was younger; a bleak narrative that has been
   packed away for over ten years. It made for a depressing evening, and
   there wasn’t even any wine in the house.

   The descent from sunny, upbeat and girlish diary entries in swirly
   handwriting to scrawled accounts of mood, medication and mental
   (in)stability is marked. From Mean Girls to Girl, Interrupted over the
   course of mere months. Eventually, I stopped writing anything of note
   and simply filled in the days with single, nonsensical words such as
   ‘another’, ‘still’ and ‘can’t’.

   My residency at the bottom of the hole is foggy in my mind, such was
   the volume of chemicals I was prescribed, and such is, likely, my
   desire to repress it all. It was a very, very unhappy period, and one
   that has had a pronounced effect on my life since.

   However.

   While there is always a hangover from any period of mental distress –
   like a skidmark on the clean white pants of your future – one thing
   I’ve taken from the whole sorry affair is resilience. A dear friend of
   mine is currently going through cognitive behavioural therapy for her
   own issues, and she maintains that she’ll be a more well-adjusted
   person for it – even more so than she was before her problems took
   hold.

   And I agree. In this life, the only person you can ever rely on is
   yourself, and if you can get yourself through a period of genuine,
   personal hell – when you can’t even trust your own damn brain to help
   you out – then you’ve seen life stripped-back to its disturbingly bleak
   core and have been given the wonderful gift of perspective.

   Which is something I need right now, since I’m not having a very good
   year at all. In moments when I feel overwhelmed by the number of crappy
   cards I’ve been dealt it’s easy for me to lose sight of how different I
   am now to the girl in these diaries. Life is tough now, but at least
   it’s a life, which is something Diary Girl was barely hanging on to.

   During those dark days I saw countless therapists and mental health
   professionals. Some were great. Some made me feel much worse. But one
   woman – whose name I regrettably can’t remember – encouraged me to
   express my feelings through drawing. I have all the artistic ability of
   a goat wielding a pencil so it wasn’t something that came easily to me,
   but I do remember it helped a considerable amount. Last night I found a
   pile of those drawings and felt quite shaken by them, such was the
   force of the memories they evoked. But I found them underneath a pile
   of love letters, travel tickets and photographs that illustrate my life
   since that time.

   And I felt an overwhelming sense of perspective.
