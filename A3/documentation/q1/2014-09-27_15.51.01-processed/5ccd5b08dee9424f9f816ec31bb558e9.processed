[16]Solidarite avec les migrants de Calais!: SEP 5-7 Weekend of Antifascist
resistance.

   There is no place for fascists in Calais. We will resist this neo-nazi
   rally. We will resist the recent wave of fascist street attacks. But
   with possibly hundreds of neonazis arriving, we cannot do this alone.
   We call on antifascists from across France, and across Europe, to join
   us for a gathering of solidarity through the weekend of 5-7 September.

   We need your support to shut down ‘Sauvons Calais’ demo. We need your
   support to help defend homes and meeting places under attack. We also
   want to invite musicians, film-makers, and others to come and join us
   to make an international festival of resistance! From 1940 to 2014,
   French people and immigrants from all over the world have repeatedly
   united to defeat nazism. We want to celebrate this tradition with
   action, and also with events such as concerts, film-showings,
   discussions and more. We welcome all proposals and expressions of
   solidarity in the coming days.

[19]France: Calais refugees hold demo against police violence as the
far-right closes in.

   Refugees claim to have experienced an increase in the number of
   physical attacks by French police in the past week and say that they
   have no confidence that they will protect them when a far right
   anti-immigration group marches in Calais on Sunday. ”In the last weeks
   many of us had to face a lot of police violence,” said one of the
   migrants, whose identity was not disclosed. “Some of us got broken
   hands and others broken legs and even some got hurt their heads,” they
   said.

[23]The Refugee crisis in Calais shows the EU’s failure to see the big
picture.

   A scene both horrifying and heartening is unfolding across the Channel
   in Calais. There are hundreds of tired, hungry young men in makeshift
   camps, skulking in corners, massing with intent, playing a dangerous,
   occasionally violent game of cat and mouse with the authorities. Given
   the slightest chance, they will squeeze themselves into cars and
   airless lorries. Just this week more than 200, from the 1,200 in the
   vicinity, attempted to storm a passenger ferry. No plan is too
   outlandish, no wheeze too risky. Anything to get to Britain.

   The world is getting richer, but also more unequal.

[26]Israel: Reverse Illegal Plans for WestBank, will amount to war crime.

   Israel should immediately reverse its illegal appropriation of a large
   swath of land in the occupied West Bank south of Jerusalem, Human
   Rights Watch said today. The appropriation, announced on September 1,
   2014, paves the way for substantial settlement construction near the
   West Bank town of Bethlehem. Transferring civilian settlers into
   occupied territory would amount to a war crime.

[29]ICYMI: US fast food workers strike nationwide, demand living wages.

   Fast-food workers and activists protested in more than 100 cities
   across the country demanding higher wages and better working
   conditions. The protests are the latest in a series of actions over the
   past few years aimed at calling attention to the plight of fast-food
   workers, who typically earn near the minimum wage and are subject to
   erratic schedules.

[32]Fred Ritchin: Why Violent News Images Matter

   A recent slew of situations resulting in catastrophic violence and
   death, including the Israel-Gaza war, the armed expansion of the
   Islamic State, the downing of a Malaysian Airlines plane in the
   Ukraine, the ongoing conflict in Syria, and also the spread of the
   Ebola virus, has led to a renewed debate as to what kinds of imagery
   media outlets should be expected to show.

[40]A Massive Oil Spill Is Threatening Mexico’s Third Largest City’s Water
Supply

   For Mexico’s state oil giant, the expansion of organised crime into
   fuel theft is a growing menace. Now, a bungled attempt to illegally tap
   an oil pipeline has threatened an environmental disaster in the
   northern state of Nuevo Leon, after an estimated [41]4,000 barrels of
   crude oil poured into the San Juan River.

[45]Afghanistan: Trapped, then poisoned: Kabul’s ruthless dog cull

   Cornered against a wall and with a steel hook pushed around his neck,
   the dog emits a savage howl in a desperate attempt to fight free, but
   poison will soon be forced into his mouth as Kabul’s cull of strays
   claims another kill.

   About 17,600 dogs were poisoned last year by municipal workers in the
   Afghan capital in an effort to protect residents from disease and to
   control the rocketing population of canines that roam the city’s
   streets and open ground

[48]The Hannibal Directive: How Israel Killed Its Own Troops and Massacred
Palestinians to Prevent Soldier’s Capture

   When the Israeli army executed the Hannibal Directive in Rafah, it not
   only targeted the area where Goldin was supposedly captured, it leveled
   massive firepower against a civilian population over large swaths of a
   densely populated city of 350,000. After the assault, the White
   House [49]wrongly blamed Hamas for violating the ceasefire,
   legitimizing another piece of Israeli disinformation and whitewashing
   the violence, while only a few Israeli public figures [50]criticized
   the military’s behavior.

[52]Yemen concessions fail to end Houthi protests

   Yemen’s Houthi Shia activists are continuing to protest in the capital
   Sanaa, a day after the country’s president reached out to them by
   dismissing the government and rolling back a disputed fuel price hike.

   Houthi supporters on Wednesday brandished arms and batons while using
   tyres and cement blocks to divert traffic from main roads, including a
   boulevard that leads to government buildings and state institutions.

   Government tanks were positioned in front of the parliament and TV
   buildings.

[61]Why Aren’t Women Advancing At Work? Ask a Transgender Person.

   Trans people are bringing entirely new ways of approaching the
   discussion. Because trans people are now staying in the same careers
   (and sometimes the very same jobs) after they change genders, they are
   uniquely qualified to discuss the difference between how men and women
   experience the workplace. Their experience is as close to the
   scientific method as we can get: By isolating and manipulating gender
   as a variable and holding all other variables—skill, career,
   personality, talent—constant, these individuals reveal exactly the way
   one’s outward appearance of gender affects day-to-day interactions. If
   we truly want to understand women at work, we should listen carefully
   to trans men and trans women: They can tell us more about gender in the
   workplace than just about anyone.
