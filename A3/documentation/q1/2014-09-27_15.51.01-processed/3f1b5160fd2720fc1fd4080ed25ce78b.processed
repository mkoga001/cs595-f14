   Bill Oakley (born February 27, 1966) is an [16]American television
   writer and producer, known for his work on the animated comedy series
   [17]The Simpsons. Oakley and [18]Josh Weinstein became best friends and
   writing partners at [19]high school; Oakley then attended [20]Harvard
   University and was Vice President of the [21]Harvard Lampoon. He worked
   on several short-term media projects, including writing for the variety
   show Sunday Best, but was then unemployed for a long period.

   Oakley and Weinstein eventually penned a [22]spec script for
   [23]Seinfeld, after which they wrote "[24]Marge Gets a Job", an episode
   of The Simpsons. Subsequently, the two were hired to write for the show
   on a permanent basis in 1992. After they wrote episodes such as
   "[25]$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized
   Gambling)", "[26]Bart vs. Australia" and "[27]Who Shot Mr. Burns?", the
   two were appointed [28]executive producers and [29]showrunners for the
   [30]seventh and [31]eighth seasons of the show. They attempted to
   include several emotional episodes focusing on the [32]Simpson family,
   as well as several high-concept episodes such as "[33]Homer's Enemy",
   "[34]Two Bad Neighbors" and "[35]The Principal and the Pauper", winning
   three [36]Primetime Emmy Awards for their work.

   After they left The Simpsons, Oakley and Weinstein created [37]Mission
   Hill. The show was plagued by promotional issues and was swiftly
   canceled. They worked as [38]consulting producers on [39]Futurama, then
   created [40]The Mullets in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV
   pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on [41]Sit Down, Shut Up
   in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute. He has since
   written for [42]The Cleveland Show and [43]Portlandia, without
   Weinstein. He also served as co-executive producer and writer on
   Portlandia, sharing a [44]Writers Guild of America Award with his
   fellow writers in 2013. Oakley is married to fellow writer Rachel
   Pulido.

Early life[[57]edit]

   Oakley was born William Lloyd Oakley and raised on a farm in
   [58]Maryland.^[59][1]^[60][2] He was a fan of [61]Mad magazine from an
   early age, which helped shape his comic sensibility.^[62][2] He
   attended [63]St. Albans High School in [64]Washington D.C., where he
   met and became best friends with [65]Josh Weinstein in the eighth
   grade. The two created the school humor magazine The Alban Antic in
   1983.^[66][1]^[67][3] Such would be the length of their partnership;
   the two often finish each other's sentences.^[68][4] Oakley later
   attended [69]Harvard University, where he wrote for and served as Vice
   President of the [70]Harvard Lampoon,^[71][2] working on the famous
   1986 [72]USA Today parody issue.^[73][5] He graduated in 1988 after
   studying American history.^[74][1]^[75][6]

Career[[76]edit]

   Oakley did not land a job on a major comedy series, as previous Harvard
   graduates who wrote for the Lampoon had done, despite writing numerous
   [77]spec scripts for shows such as [78]Saturday Night Live and [79]Late
   Night with David Letterman; he moved back home.^[80][1]^[81][7] There,
   he worked in publicity, doing promotion for [82]America's Most
   Wanted.^[83][7] In their free time, Oakley and Weinstein wrote for
   local comedy groups, such as Gross National Product.^[84][1] In 1989,
   they moved to [85]New York City after being hired to write for a game
   show on [86]Ha!, before writing for a variety show on the network
   featuring [87]Denis Leary.^[88][7] The two also wrote for the
   [89]National Lampoon and [90]Spy.^[91][3] An editor of Spy was hired by
   [92]NBC to run the variety show [93]Sunday Best, and took Oakley and
   Weinstein to [94]Los Angeles with him in 1991. When the show was
   canceled after three episodes, they were unemployed for a lengthy
   period, and Oakley lived on [95]unemployment benefits.^[96][5]^[97][7]
   He later considered applying to join the [98]United States Foreign
   Service.^[99][1]

The Simpsons[[100]edit]

   "Well, we were pretty freaking dedicated, I guess. We were Simpsons
   nerds of the first order and were huge fans before we even got hired.
   It was basically the equivalent of getting hired on [101]SNL in 1978.
   The entire original staff was there. The only "new guys" were
   [102]Conan and us. We lived and breathed that show from 1992–1997."
    — Oakley on his and Weinstein's dedication to the show.^[103][8]

As a writer[[104]edit]

   After changing their [105]agent,^[106][1] they wrote a spec script for
   [107]Seinfeld, which was well received. Amongst those who liked it were
   [108]Al Jean and [109]Mike Reiss, [110]showrunners of [111]The
   Simpsons. There were no openings on the staff at the time, but Oakley
   and Weinstein were hired to write the episode "[112]Marge Gets a Job",
   based on an idea by [113]Conan O'Brien.^[114][7] The episode aired as
   part of [115]season four.^[116][7]^[117][9] Their Seinfeld script and
   The Simpsons episode caught the attention of [118]Diane English, and
   they were offered a job on a sitcom. Before they accepted this job,
   they were told that [119]Jay Kogen and [120]Wallace Wolodarsky were
   leaving The Simpsons, and then joined the writing staff on a permanent
   basis in 1992, in the [121]third season of that
   show.^[122][7]^[123][10] They began as [124]story editors.^[125][11]
   They were initially quiet and felt "intimidated", being in the same
   room as "10 of the greatest minds in comedy", but eventually started
   pitching jokes with confidence.^[126][7] They wrote their scripts
   together, working side-by-side at a computer.^[127][7] Their first
   episode as staff writers was "[128]Marge in Chains", an existing idea
   that they were assigned. The first draft of the script was based on
   research about women in prison conducted by Oakley and Weinstein,
   making it "slightly more realistic" than the final version of the
   episode, in which many realistic elements were replaced.^[129][12]

   After season four, most of the original staff left the show. Before
   [130]David Mirkin arrived to take over as showrunner for [131]season
   five, Oakley, Weinstein, O'Brien and [132]Dan McGrath were the only
   writers working on the show and spent a month mapping out most of the
   season's episodes.^[133][10] Oakley and Weinstein wrote several
   episodes for season five, penning the "Terror at 5½ Feet" segment of
   "[134]Treehouse of Horror IV",^[135][13] "[136]$pringfield (Or, How I
   Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)",^[137][14]
   "[138]Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy",^[139][15] the show's 100th episode
   "[140]Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"^[141][16] and "[142]Lady
   Bouvier's Lover".^[143][17] For [144]season six they wrote
   "[145]Sideshow Bob Roberts", basing much of the episode on the
   [146]Watergate scandal, in which they had a great interest.^[147][18]
   They also wrote "[148]Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy",^[149][19] and
   "[150]Bart vs. Australia". The writing staff wanted to do an episode in
   which the Simpsons family traveled to a foreign country; they selected
   [151]Australia because they thought that everyone in Australia had a
   good sense of humor and "would get the jokes",^[152][20] with the
   episode being intentionally inaccurate.^[153][21] The episode proved
   somewhat controversial; some Australian fans said the episode was a
   mockery of their country. Shortly after it had aired, the Simpsons
   staff received over a hundred letters from Australians who were
   insulted by the episode.^[154][22] The pair wrote the two-part episode
   "[155]Who Shot Mr. Burns?", which was initially proposed by series
   creator [156]Matt Groening.^[157][23] While deciding who the culprit
   was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched [158]Barney Gumble because he was a
   character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the
   show.^[159][24] Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier
   and wanted the culprit to be a family member.^[160][25] Oakley and
   Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and
   it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes
   and making it look like it was not a complete accident.^[161][26]

As showrunner[[162]edit]

   Oakley and Weinstein were appointed [163]executive producers and
   showrunners of the [164]seventh and [165]eighth seasons. They were
   chosen partly because they had been with the show since the third
   season and understood many of its dynamics.^[166][10] The showrunner is
   responsible for overseeing all aspects of the show's production. Each
   episode takes ten months to produce, so the showrunner must "oversee
   many different episodes in different stages of production all at the
   same time", with roles including head writer, making notes on the
   [167]storyboards and working with the voice actors, animators, editors
   and composers. Oakley and Weinstein often set two script-rewriting
   rooms in motion at the same time, delegating leadership in the rooms to
   writers such as [168]Steve Tompkins and [169]David Cohen.^[170][7]
   Mirkin, who had suggested that the two take over, remained on the show
   in an advisory capacity, helping Oakley and Weinstein with technical
   aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing.^[171][7] When
   they took over the series, they wanted many of the episodes to be
   realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the
   [172]Simpson family and explored their feelings and emotions towards
   each other.^[173][27] They wanted to produce [174]Treehouse of Horror
   episodes, episodes about [175]Sideshow Bob, [176]Itchy & Scratchy and
   several "format-bending" episodes such as "[177]22 Short Films About
   Springfield", for which Oakley wrote the [178]Principal Skinner and
   [179]Superintendent Chalmers scene, the latter being his favorite
   character.^[180][28] They aimed for "at least two episodes per season
   that 'pushed the envelope', [and] expanded the definition of what an
   episode could be."^[181][7] This was a style they employed for both
   seasons they produced.^[182][29] Season eight featured several episodes
   in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new
   issues were explored, such as divorce.^[183][29] Their preferred choice
   of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and
   several of their guest stars were "old grizzled men with distinctive
   voices" such as [184]R. Lee Ermey, [185]Donald Sutherland, [186]Kirk
   Douglas and [187]Lawrence Tierney.^[188][30] Oakley considered season
   three to be the single greatest comedic season of television ever
   produced and so attempted to recreate the feel of that season for the
   two he ran,^[189][2] focusing on stories with real emotions and
   situations, as well as some [190]off-the-wall episodes.^[191][7] Season
   three was their basis for [192]Homer: "We liked Homer the way he was in
   the second and third seasons. That was what we consciously used as our
   model. Dimwitted, loving, hyper-enthusiastic, creatively goofy, parody
   of the American father – drawn with real emotions, though admittedly
   amplified. This was exemplified in "[193]Mother Simpson", "[194]Lisa
   the Iconoclast", "[195]Diddly-Dum-Doodly", and a couple others. In some
   of the less reality-based episodes, i.e. [196]the Beer Baron one –
   usually [197]Swartzwelder's, we'd treat this stricture with a certain
   amount of latitude."^[198][8]

   One of their most notable episodes was "[199]Homer's Enemy", an episode
   designed to "push the envelope conceptually." The idea for "Homer's
   Enemy" was first conceived by Oakley, who thought that Homer should
   have an enemy. This evolved into the concept of a "real world"
   co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the
   latter as they thought it would have funnier results.^[200][31] The
   result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work
   hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and
   embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent
   laziness and ignorance.^[201][31] "Homer's Enemy" explores the comic
   possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [202]work ethic
   placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is
   portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in
   some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently
   highlighted.^[203][31]^[204][32] By the close of the episode, Grimes, a
   hard working and persevering "real American hero,"^[205][32] is
   relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be
   pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.^[206][32] Oakley says the
   episode was "hyper-[207]meta" and focused on "parodying to some degree
   the Homer we don't like. That's one of the things that episode is
   supposed to illustrate – 'Homer gone wrong'. Although, I would argue
   that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively
   stupid or immature, actually."^[208][8] Weinstein said: "We wanted to
   do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal
   person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' I know this
   episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really
   feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to
   deal with Homer. There was some talk [on NoHomers.net] about the
   ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2)
   we like the lesson of 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank
   Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last
   laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson
   could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly
   learned."^[209][7] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt
   it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly
   bad-mannered.^[210][33] On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this
   episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it
   involves sharp observational humor which many fans "didn't
   get."^[211][31] Weinstein talks about a "generation gap"—the episode
   was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among
   fans who grew up with the show.^[212][31]
   Oakley (left) along with Weinstein, [213]Mike Reiss and [214]Jeff
   Martin in 1994.

   Other episodes included "[215]Two Bad Neighbors", which sees Homer meet
   former President [216]George H. W. Bush, a reference to the show's feud
   with the Bushes in the early 1990s.^[217][34] Weinstein said that the
   episode is often misunderstood. Many audiences expected a political
   satire, while the writers made special effort to keep the parody
   apolitical.^[218][35] Oakley stresses that "it's not a political
   attack, it's a personal attack!", and instead of criticizing Bush for
   his policies, the episode pokes fun at his "crotchetiness". Oakley
   described the episode as a companion piece to "Homer's Enemy", in that
   a character is juxtaposed alongside Homer and does not get along with
   him.^[219][36]

   Oakley considered working on the show to be similar to working in a
   bubble due to the lack of interference from the Fox network's
   executives, as is commonplace on other shows.^[220][10] This allowed
   them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: "The
   great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get
   away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to
   do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like 'Two Bad
   Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because
   honestly there were no network execs there to stop us."^[221][7] Such
   was the network's limited input that, when an executive suggested the
   staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to
   "liven up the show",^[222][37] the staff rejected the idea and instead
   created the episode "[223]The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show",
   inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he
   was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the
   executive's proposal.^[224][38] The episode, which marked the point at
   which The Simpsons surpassed [225]The Flintstones for the number of
   episodes produced for an [226]animated series,^[227][39] was named by
   the [228]BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show.
   They noted "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art
   of animation and rail against network interference in their
   show."^[229][40] The intrusion of the network [230]censors was limited:
   the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the
   censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should
   be substituted, causing limited problems, as often the offending lines
   are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The
   episode "[231]Homer's Phobia" drew the censor's objections. Its script
   came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The
   censors stated that they did not like the use of the word "[232]gay",
   or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph
   which stated that "the topic and substance of this episode are
   unacceptable for [233]broadcast". The censor problems ultimately came
   to nothing; when the episode came back from animation in South Korea,
   the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the
   censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one
   line: "acceptable for broadcast".^[234][41]

Leaving the show[[235]edit]

   Oakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight
   because they "didn't want to break [the show]." Oakley said: "We always
   said we'd never do a joke that we'd done before."^[236][1] They felt
   the showrunner should not stay for more than two seasons.^[237][10] Due
   to the pressures of having to work on two seasons at once (writing
   season eight, while doing post-production of season seven), Oakley said
   that at least two episodes from season eight would ideally have been
   rewritten, had there been sufficient time,^[238][29] and that towards
   the end, they were "treading water".^[239][2] As they were working on
   [240]post-production of season eight, they were credited as consulting
   producers for [241]season nine, which was in its initial writing
   stages.^[242][7] Oakley stated that they contributed "somewhere between
   0 and .0001%" of the season, only attending the table readings of the
   scripts.^[243][7] They produced three episodes held over from season
   eight, which aired as part of season nine: "[244]The City of New York
   vs. Homer Simpson",^[245][42] "[246]The Principal and the Pauper" and
   "[247]Lisa the Simpson". "The Principal and the Pauper" was negatively
   received due the sudden revelation that long-time character
   [248]Seymour Skinner was actually an imposter. For example, in his book
   [249]Planet Simpson, [250]Chris Turner describes "The Principal and the
   Pauper" as the "broadcast that marked [the] abrupt plunge" from The
   Simpsons' "Golden Age", which he says began in the middle of the show's
   [251]third season. He calls the episode "[one of] the weakest episodes
   in Simpsons history".^[252][43] As such, Oakley considers it the most
   controversial episode from his tenure as executive producer. He and
   Weinstein advise viewers to treat "The Principal and the Pauper" as an
   "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly due
   to the fact that it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this
   was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, "[253]The Simpsons
   Spin-Off Showcase"). They describe the ending of the episode as an
   attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode
   on its own.^[254][44] "Lisa the Simpson" was their final involvement
   with the show. The duo wanted to end on a good note—Weinstein stated
   that the episode "was meant to embody the humor, depth, and emotions of
   The Simpsons,"—and they were pleased with the result.^[255][45]

Awards and critical reaction[[256]edit]

   Oakley won three [257]Emmys for his work on The Simpsons, and shared
   them with the other producers.^[258][46] When Oakley was the showrunner
   and executive producer, "Homer's Phobia" won the Emmy for
   [259]Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less) in
   1997.^[260][46] The previous year, "[261]Treehouse of Horror VI" was
   submitted for the award. The staff felt the 3D animation sequence
   "Homer³" would have given it the edge. The episode eventually lost to
   [262]Pinky and the Brain. Oakley later expressed regret about not
   submitting an episode with a more emotionally driven plot, such as
   "[263]Mother Simpson".^[264][47] In 1996, during season seven, the show
   received a [265]Peabody Award.^[266][48] Oakley shared the awards for
   "[267]Lisa's Wedding" and "[268]Trash of the Titans" in 1995 and 1998
   respectively.^[269][46]^[270][49]^[271][50] Oakley and Weinstein
   themselves were nominated, along with the show's composer [272]Alf
   Clausen, for the Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music
   and Lyrics for writing "Señor Burns" from "Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part
   Two)".^[273][46]

   Many of they episodes by Oakley and Weinstein are considered amongst
   the show's best. For example, in 2003, [274]Entertainment Weekly
   included six episodes they produced ("Homer's Phobia", "[275]A Fish
   Called Selma", "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson", "22 Short
   Films About Springfield", "[276]The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase" and
   "The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show") and one episode they wrote
   ("Who Shot Mr. Burns?") as part of their list of the show's 25 best
   episodes.^[277][51] Robert Canning of [278]IGN said the episode
   "[279]You Only Move Twice" from season eight "may well be the greatest
   Simpsons episode of all time. In my book, it's at least tied," with
   "[280]Marge vs. the Monorail".^[281][52] [282]A. O. Scott described
   their era as "reach[ing] a pinnacle of zany self-reference with "22
   Short Films About Springfield" and "Simpsons Spin-off
   Showcase"."^[283][53] The two are popular amongst the show's
   fans,^[284][8] and in the early days of the Internet, Oakley read and
   participated in fan discussion of the show on newsgroups such as
   [285]alt.tv.simpsons.^[286][2]^[287][10] In 2005 and 2006, they
   participated in two question-and-answer sessions on the fan
   [288]message board NoHomers.net.^[289][7]^[290][29]

Mission Hill and other work[[291]edit]

   After Oakley and Weinstein left The Simpsons, they created [292]Mission
   Hill in 1997, a show about a hip, lazy, 24-year-old cartoonist named
   Andy French, and sold it to [293]The WB for a fall 1999
   debut.^[294][7]^[295][54] They pitched the show in 1998 "as an animated
   series for young adults with a sophisticated, 'Simpsons'-style
   sensibility." They aimed to make the show about realistic issues
   affecting young adults, which were too mature for The
   Simpsons.^[296][1] The network was impressed and initially ordered 13
   episodes; they ordered five more once the first was completed.^[297][7]
   Oakley explained: "The audience we're going for is one that's
   sophisticated, that likes high and low humor, that's very savvy in
   animation. [But] this show is definitely a case where a lot of people
   don't get it. It's not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It's
   observational humor. It's jokes told in a weird way, in the background
   or with a bizarre sound effect."^[298][1] The show was plagued by
   "public relations" difficulties, which meant it was "tarnished" from
   the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show,
   sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual [299]upfronts, was
   poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the
   upfronts did not matter.^[300][1] Similarly, because no episodes were
   finished in time, journalists were not able to see anything of the show
   at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as
   Weinstein commented to the [301]Washington Post, "for seven months, the
   only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape
   that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even
   saw it." The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications
   such as [302]The Deseret News; and earned a positive write-up in
   [303]Variety.^[304][1] Furthermore, the show was forced to change from
   its originally planned title of The Downtowners due to its closeness to
   an [305]MTV show.^[306][1] All of these factors combined to ensure the
   show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials
   for it. Weinstein stated: "I don't know exactly why America doesn't
   know about this show. It's like [307]Teen People came out with its fall
   preview, and we're not even in it."^[308][1] Mission Hill came at a
   time when the TV schedules were already saturated with animated shows;
   some of the response could be chalked up to its genre.^[309][8]

   The show was put out on a Friday, a night on which the WB had never
   broadcast before, at 8:00 pm, a time Oakley felt was
   inappropriate,^[310][1] and aired in front of [311]The Wayans Bros.,
   [312]The Jamie Foxx Show and [313]The Steve Harvey Show, all shows with
   which Oakley felt it was "incompatible".^[314][7] The show's poor
   reviews and ratings of an average of 1.8 million led to its swift
   cancellation.^[315][8]^[316][54] Oakley concluded that the pair had
   been "very naive" with regard to producing the show,^[317][1] and that
   it "would've been better on cable anyway because it would never have
   appealed to a broad enough audience due to the subject
   matter."^[318][8] The 13 completed episodes were later aired on
   [319]Cartoon Network's [320]adult swim block and the show garnered a
   worldwide cult following. After lobbying from Oakley and Weinstein, the
   WB eventually released the series on DVD.^[321][3]^[322][7]^[323][54]

   From 2001 to 2002, the two served as [324]consulting producers on
   [325]Futurama. They worked for two-and-a-half days a week, contributing
   jokes and helping with stories. They worked most substantially on the
   episodes "[326]That's Lobstertainment!" and "[327]Roswell That Ends
   Well".^[328][7] They produced [329]The Mullets for [330]UPN in
   2003.^[331][55] Oakley and Weinstein have written and produced several
   [332]television pilots. These include a [333]CBS [334]dramedy entitled
   22 Birthdays, Business Class, a comedy for [335]NBC about two traveling
   salesmen, The Funkhousers, an off-the-wall comedy for [336]ABC about a
   close-knit family which was directed by [337]Frank Oz and The Ruling
   Class for [338]Fox, about a high school class who all got along,
   regardless of their social group.^[339][7]^[340][56]^[341][57] They
   have written two feature film screenplays: The Optimist for [342]New
   Line Cinema, in which [343]Seann William Scott was slated to star as a
   man born with no unhappiness gene,^[344][58] and Ruprecht, a [345]Santa
   Claus-related comedy for [346]Disney.^[347][59]

   Along with Weinstein, Oakley was to serve as an executive producer on
   the Fox television series [348]Sit Down, Shut Up in 2009.^[349][60]
   Oakley ended his involvement with the show due to a contract dispute
   between the staff and [350]Sony Pictures. Sony refused to offer a
   contract which operated under the complete terms of the [351]Writers
   Guild of America. Weinstein continued working on the show.^[352][61]
   His two subsequent projects have been without Weinstein. In late 2009,
   NBC commissioned a pilot for Oakley's sitcom about "the youngest judge
   in a circuit courthouse."^[353][62] He wrote the 2010 episode of
   [354]The Cleveland Show "[355]Gone with the Wind".^[356][63] Amongst
   other projects, Oakley planned a live-action show where the characters
   are all robots, which would be made by the same people who produce the
   children's show [357]Yo Gabba Gabba!.^[358][2] Oakley began writing for
   the sketch comedy show [359]Portlandia in its second season. He became
   a co-executive producer from the show's third season, co-writing every
   episode with [360]Fred Armisen, [361]Carrie Brownstein and Jonathan
   Krisel.^[362][64]^[363][65] He and his fellow writers shared the
   [364]Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Achievement in
   Writing Comedy/Variety (Including Talk) – Series in
   2013.^[365][66]^[366][67] Oakley and Weinstein will again team up to
   co-write and co-executive produce 22 Birthdays, the failed pilot they
   originally produced for CBS, as a pilot for [367]Bravo. [368]Doug Liman
   and [369]Dave Bartis will also be co-executive producers. It is set to
   air in 2013.^[370][68]

Personal life[[371]edit]

   Oakley and his wife Rachel J. Pulido^[372][69] have two daughters Mary
   and Elizabeth,^[373][3] and a son named James.^[374][70] He and his
   family live in [375]Portland, Oregon.^[376][2]

   Pulido (born January 26, 1967) graduated from Harvard, where she was a
   writer for the Harvard Lampoon. She wrote for The Simpsons and Mission
   Hill and was the only [377]Hispanic staff writer in the twenty-year
   history of The Simpsons.^[378][71] She has said that she thinks of
   herself as Mexican.^[379][72] Pulido wrote the episode "[380]Grade
   School Confidential",^[381][73] and the [382]Bumblebee Man segment of
   "22 Short Films About Springfield".^[383][70]
