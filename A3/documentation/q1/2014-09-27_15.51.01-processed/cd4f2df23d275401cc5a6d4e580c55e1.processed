[37]The Anonfather, an @exiledsurfer remix feat. Anonymous Sabu

   Submitted by exiledsurfer on Tue, 2013-10-22 11:25.

   The Anonfather, an[38] @exiledsurfer remix. (click image to enlarge or
   download)


   Anonymous Sabu is back in the [39]Twews, supposedly hacking the
   [40]@Anon_Central account, according to[41] @VinceInTheBay which of
   course is [42]a bunch of faggotry. Another [43]AnonCentral tweet along
   these lines inspired the above remix.

   Interestingly a pastebin of a [44]chat from 2011 between Sabu and
   Presstorm Jamie appeared in my timeline yesterday, where Presstorm
   Jamie tells Sabu that [45]Alexa D'Obrien is a nutcase, and 'burned both
   me and exiledsurfer'. Well, isnt that the pot calling the kettle black?
   Two snitches discussing what happened between two people who are
   anything but Anonymous - Me and Alexa. I assume what Jamie is referring
   to is me having been working together with Alexa at [46]Wikileaks
   Central when she Started [47]@USDayOfRage, which later morphed with
   Occupy Wall Street. (Yes, i was an early author at WLCentral, as was
   [48]@Asher_Wolf - both of us were 'pushed out'.  [49]@kgosztola had
   started his stellar career there as well, landing a job with The
   Nation's [50]@GregMitch, and later moving to FireDogLake as
   [51]@FDLDissenter.)

   At the time Alexa conceived of US Day of Rage (the name came from the
   first Egyptian Revolution's Day of Rage) she and i were working
   simultaneously on a project called Tethr with [52]@huslage and Alexa
   was stretched pretty thin with her time. She decided to focus on
   USDayOfRage, and we parted ways amiably. In no way was i 'burned' by
   Alexa. [53]We also worked on vivantleakers.org together, and Alexa went
   on to [54]document the historical Bradley Manning Kangaroo Court. Her
   Transcripts are appearing in a[55] book illustrated by another mate of
   mine, Clark Stoekley of [56]@WikileaksTruck fame.

   I had done [57]the original logo and posters promoting US Day Of Rage,
   and Alexa was concerned about copyright claims that i might make, and
   stopped using the artwork. In no way did she 'burn me'. At the time,
   Alexa was remaining in the background, not announcing her affiliation
   with starting the USDOR identity, because she did not want it to be
   about her as a person. There were many concerns in those days about
   infiltration and government monitoring as well, and Alexa's concerns
   (some would have said at that time, paranoia) turned out to be true.
   All kinds of government agencies were tracking what Alexa and Occupy
   Wall Street were doing. Of course that made me 'guilty by association'.
   It is no secret that [58]my artwork is censored in gov't networks, nor
   that i am on all kinds of 'dissident lists' for making [59]artwork
   about different 'revolutionary movements'...

   Anyway, back to the Puppetmaster (lol) and snitch, Anonymous Sabu. At
   the time of Jamie and Sabu's chat, Lulzsec was at the end of The Summer
   of Lulz, and none of us knew (but some suspected) that Sabu had been
   compromised, and I was doing a lot of artwork about [60]Lulzsec. Sabu
   approached me to do a new Avatar for him, [61]you can read the chatlogs
   between us here. I later realized that Sabu was already compromised at
   this point, So it's clear that I was already on the FBI's radar. I was
   never involved with Lulzsec , or [62]Anonymous for that matter, they
   were public events that i was commenting on creatively.

   As far as Presstorm Jamie is concerned, she was always trying to get me
   to support Presstorm, asking me to write for the website, and wanting
   to crosspost my artwork, in an attempt to gain credibility. She always
   'felt wrong' to me, instincts which were confirmed as she exploded and
   took down a bunch of anons with her.  Wheels within wheels, and me just
   an artist communicating with all these people betraying each other,
   many of them run by the government.

   So in a certain sense, Sabu is right - there are sects of Anonymous
   that are 'puppets on a string', with him as the Anonfather.

   Ah, the lulz.

[118]The Stock Market, Explained

   Submitted by exiledsurfer on Thu, 2013-06-20 10:05.


   Once upon a time in a place overrun with monkeys, a man appeared and
   announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each. The
   villagers, seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the
   forest, and started catching them. The man bought thousands at $10 and
   as supply started to diminish, they became harder to catch, so the
   villagers stopped their effort.

   The man then announced that he would now pay $20 for each one. This
   renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys
   again. But soon the supply diminished even further and they were ever
   harder to catch, so people started going back to their farms and forgot
   about monkey catching. The man increased his price to $25 each and the
   supply of monkeys became so sparse that it was an effort to even see a
   monkey, much less catch one.

   The man now announced that he would buy monkeys for $50! However, since
   he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy
   on his behalf. While the man was away the assistant told the villagers:
   "Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has bought. I
   will sell them to you at $35 each and when the man returns from the
   city, you can sell them to him for $50 each." The villagers rounded up
   all their savings and bought all the monkeys.

   However, they never saw the man nor his assistant again and once again
   there were monkeys everywhere.

   Now you have a better understanding of how the stock market works.

[153]Whistling Pigs and Social Media: @exiledsurfer interviews @BenPosch of
@Stackfm

   [155]Whistling Pigs and Social Media: @exiledsurfer interviews Ben
   Posch of @Stackfm from [156]exiledsurfer on [157]Vimeo.


   Sometime last year i was tweeting about drinking a whiskey cola, and
   this guy named [158]@BenPosch tweeted at me that i had never tasted a
   good whiskey until i tried a Rye called [159]Whistle Pig. We agreed to
   meet for a glass (turns out he is an expatriate American living in my
   current hometown, Vienna), and it never happened. Fast Forward to April
   2013, and a new account, [160]@StackFM shows up in my follower list on
   twitter,calling itself 'a free social network that lets you decide how
   public or private you want to be'. Being the curious type that i am, i
   followed them back, and asked 'what's up'. It turns out that it's good
   ol' Ben Posch that's doin the do. He told me that they were about to
   launch a crowdfunding to get the project out of the box, so i asked him
   for an interview - and he reminded me of the Whistle Pig whiskey we
   agreed to drink together. So, here's a couple of nerds talking about
   Social Media, and how he and the web got to where we are that makes
   [161]Stack an interesting startup to watch.
