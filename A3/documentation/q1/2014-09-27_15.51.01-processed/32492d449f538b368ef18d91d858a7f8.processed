   Tracking the Rise of ISIS

   Middle East Forum Shillman-Ginsburg Fellow Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi has
   been closely tracking the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) for two
   years. Much of what the outside world knows about the mysterious
   contagion enveloping much of Iraq and Syria can be traced to his
   pioneering work.
   For some of Jawad Al-Tamimi's more accessible writings, see the sidebar
   to the right. For more highly detailed research and translations of
   Arabic source materials related to ISIS, visit his [94]web site.

   The Middle East Forum, a Philadelphia-based think tank, works to define
   and promote American interests in the Middle East and protect Western
   values from Middle Eastern threats. It does this in three main ways:
     * Intellectually: Through the [105]Middle East Quarterly, [106]staff
       writings, [107]lectures and [108]conference calls, the Forum
       provides context, insights, and policy recommendations.
     * Operationally: The Forum exerts an active influence through its
       projects, including [109]Campus Watch, [110]Islamist Watch, the
       [111]Legal Project, the [112]Washington Project, and the
       Shillman/Ginsburg Writing Fellowship Program.
     * Philanthropically: The Forum distributes nearly $1.5 million
       annually through its [113]Education Fund, helping researchers,
       writers, investigators, and activists around the world.
