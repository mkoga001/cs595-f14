   This privacy policy is applicable to the Website[s] accessible at

Types Of Information That May Be Collected

   The following are the types of information we may collect:

Information You Provide Us

   In the course of using the website, we may ask you to provide us with
   certain information, including contact information (such as your name,
   mailing address, email address, phone number, or zip code), unique
   identifiers (such as your user ID and password), demographic
   information (such as your date of birth or gender), financial
   information (such as your credit card number) or similar information.

   Personal information that you provide to us, such as your user ID and
   password, name, email address, telephone number, physical address,
   birth date, gender or zip code or other information may be collected
   via the Site.

Site Usage Information

   We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you
   visit the Site. For example, we may collect click-stream data and your
   IP address.

Email Communications

   When you open emails from the Site, we may receive a confirmation
   noting you opened an email from us, if your computer supports such
   capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and
   what emails you may be receiving from us and our subsidiaries and
   affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what types of emails you
   have opted to and not to receive.

Information from Other Sources

   We may receive information about you from other sources within the
   Patriots organization (such as the Patriots ProShop or Premium Seating)
   in order to better understand how you interact with us for content and
   marketing purposes, and add that information to your personal
   information that we have collected.

How Information May Be Collected

   We may collect information from you in several different areas on the
   Site, including but not limited to those described below:

Registration

   You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide
   personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a
   user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the
   Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters,
   Contests, Forums, Fantasy or other subscription-based services.
   Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the
   opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the
   Website.

Newsletters and Site Emails

   We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the
   Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our
   business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a
   newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in
   conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have
   registered on the Site. You may cancel your free email subscription by
   following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some instances,
   in the designated area of certain newsletters or emails.

Contests or Sweepstakes

   We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site which may
   require registration. Your personally identifiable information may be
   used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery
   confirmation or other related purposes. We may ask your permission to
   allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as
   on a winners page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. We
   will not post your information without your permission. In some
   instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a
   contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information. In
   those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or
   sweepstakes, we have no control over the information collected and
   accordingly urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy
   policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

Surveys or Voting

   From time–to-time we may request personally identifiable information
   from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and
   you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose
   information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part
   in a survey.

Cookies

   As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called "cookies."
   A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on
   your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the
   computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify
   your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the
   Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and
   where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know
   non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being
   used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make
   using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your
   passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website,
   cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not.
   Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained
   from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to
   personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the
   Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you.
   If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,
   your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or
   delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may
   not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the
   use of cookies. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use
   cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these
   cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this Site
   only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Opting out of Third Party Cookies

   If you would like to manage the cookies set or accessed on your
   computer by third parties, including our business partners (e.g.,
   advertisers) you must visit their respective website(s).  In addition
   to those business partners whose cookies we cannot access or control,
   the Site permits the following entity to place cookies on the Site:

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

   Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology
   called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better
   manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
   Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
   function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web
   users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer
   hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are
   about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie
   the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally
   identifiable information.

Flash LSOs

   We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your
   preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display
   content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your
   visit.  Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features
   on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing
   activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

   Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount
   of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided
   by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage
   privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:

IP Addresses and Click-stream Data

   We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of
   system administration and to report aggregate information to our
   advertisers and sponsors. An IP address is a number that is
   automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the
   Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When
   you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log your IP address.
   Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you
   request Web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include such
   information as the page served, the time, the source of the request,
   the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and
   other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us
   analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most
   popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in
   particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

Transaction Information

   If you order any information from our Site, buy any of our products or
   subscribe for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you
   to complete an order form that will request certain information from
   you, including financial information such as a credit card number and
   expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information.
   We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have
   requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services
   that you order, and to invoice you. Such information is collected and
   stored through encrypted means for your protection.

Email-A-Friend

   If you choose to use our "Email to Friend" service to send an article
   to a friend from our site, we will ask you for your email address and
   your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a
   one-time email from your email address, inviting him or her to read the
   article on the site. Patriots.com does not store this information.
