       The south of Russia is full of large but friendly villages where
       long-time residents never turn down a photo with an old neighbor.

Photo essay: Russia by Train

   [9]Originally published by GlobalPost

   Over the past two summers, my family has taken train trips to central
   and southern regions of Russia. There is no lack of visually
   interesting material along the way. Train travel remains the cheapest
   and most convenient method of transportation across the vast distances
   of the largest country on Earth.

   Stops at various stations can last from five minutes to several hours.
   Passengers leave their cars to buy fresh (and sometimes not-so-fresh)
   cooked potatoes, pies and fish usually sold by local women from
   makeshift concession stands. Station-side markets offer fruits and
   vegetables as the train crosses into southern regions. In the trains,
   tea is served in glasses with metal holders called podstakanniki.

   Tea, fried chicken and hard-boiled eggs prepared at home in advance are
   as inseparable from long distance train travel as the tracks
   themselves. The photos in the slide show above were taken on various
   legs of my familyâ€™s journeys and at our eventual destinations.
