       This 'Who Wore It Better' is a three-way battle between members of
       some of K-pop's hottest groups: T-ara's Jiyeon, A Pink's Na-Eun,

       the dress giving the illusion of a two-piece outfit.  The extra

       According to researchers from the Korean Face Institute, the
       average face of South Koreans will look different by 2100. How
       Koreans will look in 2100Researchers came to this prediction after
       running a computer simulation with 20,000 photos of South Korean
       faces. As seen in the picture above, researchers believe that
       within 100 years women will have natural double eyelids, and both
       men and women will have thicker eyebrows and wider foreheads.
