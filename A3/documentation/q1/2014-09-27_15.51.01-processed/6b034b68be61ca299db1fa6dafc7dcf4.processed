   PARTICLE MACE is an upcoming 1-4 player game for Windows/Mac/iOS by
   Andy Wallace about defending yourself in a hostile universe by swinging
   particles into enemies.

   PARTICLE MACE is a game about capturing the thrill of classic arcade
   games with a new, physics based mechanic.

   PARTICLE MACE is a game about trying not to die, but that's impossible.

   PARTICLE MACE likes your friends

   It will even let you kill your friends, which can be a lot of fun! Or
   you can play with them in co-op arcade mode, but wouldn't you rather
   smash them?

   Getting In On This Action

   Maybe you saw this and thought "I'd like to play that." Well good news:
   PARTICLE MACE is in alpha! For a discounted price you can get in on the
   action and yell at me when things aren't to your liking. But unlike
   normal yelling, this yelling results in me changing the game to fit
   your hopes and dreams.
   Buying the game now will guarantee you all builds up through release,
   any updates after that point and a Steam key if you want it, as well as
   one for GOG/Desura if it ever comes out on those platforms. What you
   definitely don't get is any DRM. You buy it, it's yours.
   (Steam has some DRM. Humble and [23]Itch.io do not)
   This alpha is only for the PC/Mac version of the game. iOS folks will
   just have to wait. Playing with Xbox/PS3 controllers is recommended.

   What are people saying?

   Your thumbs ride the analog sticks as if a space cowboy with a mean
   lasso technique.

   [24]Kill Screen

   A complex physics based battle royal.

   [25]Greenlit Gaming

   The elegant movements of your ship are like a ballet of geometrical
   anarchy.

   [26]Cue Indie Review

   It's a dangerous concoction of old and new. Dangerous because it eats
   time.

   [27]Indie Statik

   A rad little game, all controlled with a single joystick/thumbstick.

   [28]Game Revolution

   In Particle Mace, the only way to survive long enough to accomplish any
   worthwhile objectives is to lose yourself in the greater context,
   ceding what seem to be immediate interests for the good of those whose
   fates are tied up in yours.
   In other words, in Particle Mace, the only way to win is by becoming a
   better person.
