[9]Why are these needed again?

   Posted on [10]September 21, 2014 by [11]TheShannonWiley

   After what happened in Ferguson, Miss., the eyes of the world have been
   on local police forces and claims of abuse of power. Everything
   officers and their departments do now is being scrutinized for better
   or for worse, and possibly for good reason.

   What does not help calm this controversy down, though, are the
   militarized vehicles and weapons local police forces are given freely
   through a new Pentagon program, especially when this gear is being sent
   to departments which are currently under scrutiny for civil rights
   violations, as the Associated Press reported today is happening across
   the country.

   The article, entitled “Feds Censure Local Police, Yet Give Lethal
   Weapons,” explains that The Pentagon’s consultation with the Justice
   Department will have to be looked at to ensure that departments
   “untrustworthy” do not obtain these resources, since it has been
   “lacking” and that investigations into departments were not looked into
   when dispersing weapons, according to a Defense Department official who
   oversees The Pentagon’s program.

   Within the past five years, 20 departments have had to have civil
   rights investigations opened about them, but apparently being under
   investigation or having had an investigation done on a department does
   not disqualify them from this military equipment.

   This article specifically focuses on the Los Angeles Police Department,
   but is a huge deal across the country.

   Nationally: How much different could the Ferguson situation have been
   if their local police force was not militarized? How much did their
   appearance and props lead to the perception of the officers being
   overly aggressive? With officers under investigation, access to more
   lethal weapons could have been restricted, especially when it was seen
   how negatively locals and the rest of the country reacted to them
   having and using them.

   Regionally: Baltimore City is an extremely unsafe place, and often with
   high crime comes high distrust or resentment towards police who are
   cracking down. Put military grade weapons in their hands and have them
   driving down the street in tanks, approachability of police will
   certainly not go up which could lead to more resentment, more
   aggression, and ultimately even more crime.

   Locally: Salisbury Police Department is currently facing three federal
   level civil suits for excessive force against Salisbury University
   students and city locals.  This does not sound like the optimal
   department to entrust with extremely dangerous utilities. Also, It is
   no secret in the city that neither local-police nor student-police
   relations are good, and once again, making the police less approachable
   is no way to improve that.

   Critique: Since militarized police and police aggression/abuse of power
   is such a hot topic across the board in America currently, this article
   would have been much better if it covered different places across the
   country where there are issues like the there are with the LAPD.  This
   is especially true because the Associated Press is not a local or even
   a regional paper. Their readership reaches across the country so in
   order to connect most effectively, a wider range of coverage should
   have happened.

   However, for what the author did cover, the story was good. There were
   excellent sources, including specific officials within both the Justice
   Department and The Pentagon, and had good background information to
   make sure all readers were on the same page. Objectivity was sound and
   organization was clear.

[21]Salisbury City Police Department faces lawsuit brought by students
and locals

   Posted on [22]September 16, 2014 by [23]TheShannonWiley

   BY SHANNON WILEY

   News Editor

   The Salisbury Police Department and an SPD officer are being sued for
   using excessive force by a group of three Salisbury University
   students, as well as a boy and his aunt in two different occasions in
   May and August.

   Both suits are being filed by Salisbury attorney Luke Rommel.

   The first suit involves alumni Curtis Adams, Travis Guthrie and senior
   Abdi Geleta who were arrested in May; Adams was arrested for alleged
   disorderly conduct while Guthrie and Geleta were charged with allegedly
   obstructing and hindering a police officer.

   In both cases the arresting officer was Officer Justin Aita.

   “My question that I’ve never had answered is what were they obstructing
   and what did they hinder,” Rommel asked.

   After being arrested, the plaintiffs were detained and jailed for
   nearly 24 hours.

   “There was no lawful, reasonable or apparent reason for the Plaintiffs’
   seizure, detention, arrest or the use of police force that was
   inflicted upon them, other than the fact they were targeted as
   Salisbury University students,” the plaintiffs’ lawsuit states.

[35]Salisbury University Code of Conduct revised for student benefits

   Posted on [36]September 16, 2014 by [37]TheShannonWiley

   BY SHANNON WILEY

   News Editor

   The code of conduct for Salisbury University was revised this year,
   adding new policies, adjusting others and making the entire code
   reportedly more straight forward and easier to follow.

   “They’re definitely trying to make it more student friendly,” said
   junior Stephanie Keller.

   One of the main changes to the code is the addition of medical amnesty,
   something that Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of
   Students Valerie Randall-Lee is very happy with.

   Medical amnesty means that if a student or someone a student is with
   that is under the influence of alcohol or drugs and needs help, the
   student or friend can call for assistance and neither will receive
   punishment from the school.

   “The biggest goal is that we don’t want to see someone die because they
   were scared to get in trouble,” Randall-Lee said.

   If something like this happens, the school can still request that the
   student who was under the influence talk to a counselor or someone
   similar about how they got into that situation and how to avoid it in
   the future. If the student ignores the request they could face
   repercussions.

      Medical amnesty could also be taken away if one student requests it
   often, or has to call for help frequently, which Randall-Lee says “is
   rare” at other schools she’s seen this enacted in.

   “They may not be eligible for medical amnesty anymore because they have
   a problem. We’d want to get them help, and they may have to have the
   floor fall out from under them before they get help,” Randall-Lee said.

[47]Salisbury City Downtown Trolley makes university debut

   Posted on [48]September 16, 2014 by [49]TheShannonWiley

   BY SHANNON WILEY

   News Editor

   The newest mode of transportation for Salisbury University students,
   faculty, staff and local residents, the Downtown Trolley, was unveiled
   last Thursday, a shuttle that goes throughout the city, to campus and
   Downtown Salisbury.

   The Downtown Trolley is the first of its kind in Salisbury run through
   Shore Transit. It will run constantly on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
   nights from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. and costs one dollar to ride.

   The trolley makes seven stops in total, picking up at the university in
   the Purdue Hall parking lot and also picking up at University Park and
   University Orchard. Each night it will work in 40 minute or less
   cycles, only stopping once for a refueling halfway through the night.
   The trolley holds 13 two-seater benches, one trolley-wide bench in the
   back, and offers standing room.

   “We are creating a new brand of urban pioneer for our city,” Salisbury
   Mayor Jim Ireton said during the opening ceremony Thursday.

   One of the central purposes of this Trolley, agreed the many speakers
   at the ceremonial ribbon cutting, is to bring more people, especially
   the SU students and staff, into downtown in the next step to invigorate
   and strengthen the area.

   Speakers included Ireton, Salisbury City Council President Jacob Day,
   Wicomico County Executive Rick Pollitt, Chairman of the Tri-County
   Council for the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland Jim Purnell, and SU
   Vice President of Student Affairs Dane Foust.

   “This linkage is so critical between the university and downtown,” Day
   said.

[59]Memory of Elizabeth Belavance lives on

   Posted on [60]September 16, 2014 by [61]TheShannonWiley

   BY SHANNON WILEY

   Editor

   Elizabeth Bellavance, an academic advocate and wife of former Salisbury
   University President Thomas Bellavance died from cancer in Richmond,
   Virginia on July 24 at the age of 77.

   Since her late husband’s presidency at SU beginning in 1980, Elizabeth
   Bellavance was extremely involved with the university, especially the
   honors program.

   She often attended lectures, performances and events put on by
   different departments and planned fundraisers for SU’s programs.
   Bellavance also heavily supported the Salisbury Symphony Orchestra and
   the WSCL radio station, which she was a founding member of.

      Within the Bellavance Honors Program, which her husband founded,
   Bellavance was always involved, even when she could not be there. When
   she wasn’t there, she was sent pictures and packets so that she could
   stay current on the events and status of the program.

   Even though he never met her in person, Bellavance Honors Program
   Director James Buss, who took on the role at the beginning of the
   2013-2014 school year, said that Bellavance was always willing to help
   him.
