   Having now looked at [44]the overall effect a coaching change might
   have on a team, and [45]identified some outstanding examples where a
   coaching change had a drastic impact on a team, it’s now time to shift
   over to some juicier matters. For the most part, I don’t think one
   coaching change is necessarily sufficient to say a coach is good or
   bad; there is a possibility the previous coach was just that bad. But
   if the coach returns the same signal a couple of times or more, you are
   probably getting closer to a true reading on what they might bring to
   the table.

   Across the 140 or so coaching changes these last 60 years where both
   coaches led the team 20+ games, there were 69 coaches who were a part
   of that change twice or more (which, to me, is quite a remarkable
   number). The full list, followed by an explanation of the measures:

[47]Remembering Dellow: A few graphs to convince you on Corsi

   From Wikipedia Commons

   Over the past year, I based a lot of research off of  former work by
   Tyler Dellow. It is a bit funny because I actually never read any of
   Dellow’s work until well after I started writing about underlying
   metrics in hockey. I knew of him, but mostly was brought up on Gabriel
   Desjardins, Eric Tulsky, Ben Wendorf (yes, Hockey-Graphs’ own
   Wendorff), and a few others. It is also a bit difficult now because
   Dellow’s website has gone dark with his hiring, which removed the work
   I quoted or built upon.

   One Dellow article that will be severely missed is [58]Two Graphs and
   480 words will convince you on Corsi.

   Dellow presented analytical data in simple and effective ways. It made
   understanding of complex concepts -such as regression in goal
   differentials- easy.

   Michel Therrien has an interesting distinction in [84]the research I’ve
   been doing about NHL coaching changes: he’s given me 4 instances where
   he and his replacement have coached 20+ games within the same season.
   He’s also replaced or been replaced in three of those instances by
   legit coaching talent – he replaced Alain Vigneault for the Montreal
   Canadiens in 2000-01, was replaced two years later by Claude Julien,
   and lastly was fired in favor of Dan Bylsma for Pittsburgh in 2008-09.
   What’s incredible about these three cases is that, in every single one
   of them, there was a drastic change in outcomes for the teams involved.
   Using 2pS%, or possession measured by two-period shots-for divided by
   two-period shots-for and against together, the numbers tell a story:

   I set out to measure the top goaltenders of each decade using a simple
   measure that adjusts for different environments of the years played.

   The measure used is Saves Above League Average which is a measure of
   how many pucks a goalie stops relative to league average from that
   season. It is computed as:

   [109]salaformula

   I compiled the top 10 and bottom 10 for the cumulative totals for the
   decades and the most extreme single-season marks.

   If you want to test yourself before looking at the results, I made them
   into Sporcle quizzes: [110]2000s / [111]1990s / [112]1980s

[114]Ryan Johansen – How much is he worth on a Bridge Deal?

   [115]September 18, 2014September 18, 2014[116]garik16 [117]NHL Topical
   Analysis [118]Bridge Deal, [119]Contract Value, [120]Contracts,
   [121]Johansen [122]1 Comment

   Courtesy of Wikimedia.org

   The Ryan Johansen contract dispute is the biggest contract talk going
   in the NHL as training camps begin, as you might expect.  Johansen is
   young, with a great pedigree (4th overall in 2010), and is coming off a
   seemingly breakout season that also led Columbus to its first playoff
   relevance in quite a while.  And yet Johansen is unsigned and is
   unlikely to be so going into camp, with the Columbus front office
   opening fire this week on Johansen’s agent.

   Both sides have seemingly agreed at least to a bridge deal – Johansen
   at first was seriously against such a deal, but has since agreed a 2
   year deal is acceptable.  But they are WAY apart on the money – reports
   have Columbus at 3 to 3.5 Million over 2 years while Johansen is
   sitting at 6 to 6.5 Million.  But what is reasonable for a player’s
   first two RFA years?

   A quick note:  This article is considering how much those years are
   worth in the league’s current economic structure, which is team
   friendly and makes RFA deals less pricey than UFA ones.  You can argue
   whether this is unfair to the player or not (it’s not), but if a player
   wants to fight the system is recourse is to either go to the KHL or not
   sign and “hold out” – see Ryan O’Reilly a few years ago for an example.
    Since nearly all players don’t want to do that and accept the league’s
   economic framework eventually, that’s the framework we’ll be using for
   this post.

   How good do you feel because your team has a new coach? I mean,
   really…it’s almost like a new-car smell. So many possibilities – This
   time, things will be different. With the exception of coaching changes
   due to disastrous, unexpected things, the typical hockey fan was ready
   for that moment, and were happy to see the coach go. But is that
   eagerness for change based on real results?

[143]Scoring talent influence on goal differentials and statistical
double dipping

   [144]September 9, 2014September 9, 2014[145]garret9 [146]Theory

   [151]P/60, [152]point production, [153]wins [154]Leave a comment

   [155]Screen shot 2014-09-09 at 1.20.24 AM

   In August, I wrote an article on how you can [156]translate Corsi
   differential values in terms of the average expected goal differential
   given for a players of similar average ice time.

   In the article, I used an example of how this information could be
   used:

     For example, Matt Halischuk and Eric Tangradi are two players who
     averaged 4th line minutes on the Winnipeg Jets. Tangradi finished
     the season with a 53.9% Corsi, while Halischuk was at 44.0%. Over
     the span of a season, forwards with those Corsi% would be expected
     to have on average of -1.04 and a -4.77 goal differential
     respectively. Therefore, on average, a 53.9% Corsi fourth line
     forward is worth 3.73 goals more than a 44.0% Corsi forward. Another
     option is comparing these players to the 46.8% Corsi% of an average
     fourth line player. The goal differentials can then be used to
     estimate win values using [157]Pythagorean relationships.

     There is a caveat with using raw Corsi% to estimate goal
     differentials; all effects -such as zone starts- still apply. The
     estimated goal differentials would be no more predictive than Corsi
     is; however, you can now easily and more accurately measure Corsi
     impact in terms of goals and wins.

   Now, I used the example of Halischuk and Tangradi for a few reasons.
   The main one being that they are familiar to me as Winnipeg Jets
   players. They are two fourth line players that have experienced similar
   usage but have very polar opposite shot metrics. But, there is another
   reason… an interesting one.

[159]To Draft or Not To Draft Goalies – Not Really the Right Question

   [160]September 4, 2014September 18, 2014[161]garik16 [162]Theory
   [163]Draft, [164]Entry Draft, [165]Goalies, [166]Goaltenders,
   [167]Goaltending [168]1 Comment

   On Monday, [169]Kyle Alexander and [170]CAustin (aka the Puckologist)
   [171]wrote a post on [172]Raw Charge titled “It’s still okay for an NHL
   team to draft goaltenders.”  This is a topic that isn’t exactly new in
   the hockey analytics community – on this site alone Garret and myself
   have written a few posts about how unpredictable goalies are and the
   general consensus in the hockey analytics community being that goalies
   are simply not worth drafting in the early rounds of the draft, due to
   the variability on their results compared to other skaters
   (particularly forwards).

   The Raw Charge guys in their post don’t totally disagree, but do think
   the talk of avoiding goalies is a bit exaggerated by some, concluding:

     However, the gap between goalie drafting and forward drafting isn’t
     nearly as stark as it’s been made out to be. It’s much more
     worthwhile to make drafting and development at all positions better
     than to attempt to specialize in elite forwards to the exclusion of
     other positions.

   Essentially, the Raw Charge guys argue:
   1.  The Gap between skaters and goalies’ success and failure rates
   isn’t as big as people think – most evaluative measures used in such
   studies disfavor goalies by using metrics such as GP by a certain age,
   where goalies rarely get opportunities to meet such thresholds.
   2.  The response to whatever gap there actually is should be to try and
   improve goalie evaluation – similar to how Swedish and Finnish goalie
   federations’ improved early goalie training to improve their goalie
   crop – rather than to eschew goalies altogether.
   3.  The failure of goalies may also have to do with poor development
   processes rather than bad evaluation.

   While all three points do have merit, I think they’re both quite a bit
   overstated.

[174]An early look into some of the new numbers available

   From Wikipedia Commons: A graph showing the minimum value of Pearson’s
   correlation coefficient that is significantly different from zero at
   the 0.05 level, for a given sample size.

   There are two new and very exciting frontiers being explored by the
   hockey analytics blogosphere. There is the manual tracking of zonal
   statistics, such as zone entries and exits. This area of research was
   first pioneered by [182]Eric Tulsky and [183]Corey Sznajder. Then there
   is the splicing of Corsi into microstates, such as looking at shot
   attempt differentials momentarily after face off wins or loses in
   particular zones. The early workers on these numbers were [184]Tyler
   Delow and [185]Muneeb Alam.
   (side note: it should not be a surprise that one of each group was
   recently picked up by a NHL team this summer)

   I recently was able to get data from the non-NHL hires named above (and
   will enjoy their contact while I can until they are picked up too).
   Sznajder provided me with zone entry and exit data for just over 60% of
   the NHL. If you would like to check out his project and contribute,
   [186]check this link. Alam sent over shot attempt events 10 seconds
   after a defensive zone face off, which was further separated into wins
   and losses.

   I originally received this data for study of the Jets and noticed what
   appeared to the eye to be a relationship, and wished to delve in
   further.

[188]Save Percentage vs the Experts: Do shots against inflate a goaltender’s
save percentage?

   percentage [197]5 Comments

   Curtesy of Wikipedia Commons

   I’ve seen many statistical articles look at different ways to determine
   whether or not shot volume inflates a goaltender’s save percentage;
   however, I’ve never been satisfied with the methods used, regardless of
   the outcomes. So, I finally went and looked at the data myself.

   It’s been [198]seven months since I’ve written anything on save
   percentage. With all that wait, you’d think I’d give you a big, long,
   and in-depth article… but I won’t.

   I had one planned, but accidentally lost all my data. Of course, errors
   always come in clumps. Instead of recovering the lost data, I ended up
   permanently removing it. To make matters worse, extraskater.com going
   black made the information a hassle to manually extract again. I
   probably could write a code (or get someone else) to draw up the
   information again… but I still have one piece remaining from the
   original data: the graph.
