[12]WELCOME TO ARTindigenous

   Posted on [13]April 11, 2013 by [14]Monique Hurteau

   Tansi ~ Hello

   Thank you for checking out ARTindigenous.

   Some of my main artistic mediums are writing & [15]stand up comedy. I
   also paint and sketch.
   So, why ARTindigenous?

   Seeing others’ creativity on canvas, molded in clay, carved in wood,
   bitten in to birch bark,  punched in to metal, tufted out of moose
   hair, painted on cardboard, etched in to bone…is a profound experience.

   ARTindigenous is my way of sharing the beautiful art of those I meet
   and giving more talented artists, and their works, a wider audience.
   Please note, any works shown on this site are posted only with prior
   explicit permission granted to Art Indigenous by the artist.  Please
   respect artists’ rights to their works.

   Delving into other art forms feeds my creativity and fills my artistic
   well which helps my writing. Writing is one of the main parts of stand
   up comedy and something I love to do. I’m exploring several other art
   forms as well and have such deep appreciation for the process we all go
   through to express ourselves in the artistic mediums we choose. Even
   the stories of how each person came to their art practice fascinates
   me.

   I know opinions vary greatly on what I’m about to say; however, in my
   opinion, and for the purposes of this website, I choose to recognize
   any artwork by an Aboriginal person to be ‘Aboriginal art’ and don’t
   believe it should be restricted solely to what is considered
   ‘traditional’.  Traditional work is beautiful.  There are many
   contemporary Aboriginal artists who blend traditional with
   non-traditional or go in a completely different direction altogether.
   I love it all and respect the choices of artists to decide what’s right
   for them.

   We all have talents and skills in such varied areas and this
   website/blog was something I could put together easily, so I did. I’d
   love to help get your works seen by more people!

   Meegwetch ~ Thank You
   Monique Hurteau

[47]FRED FROM NORTH BAY, ON

   FIRST NATIONS ARTIST

   I just met a multi-talented artist, Fred, from Nipissing First Nation.
   I received one of his beautiful masks as a gift after a comedy
   performance I did in North Bay, ON for a training event hosted by
   Nipissing First Nation.

   The mask, the gift, the wonderful people…was overwhelming and, of
   course, I began to cry. Perfect for just after comedy. Can’t just have
   all laughter, right?!

   The mask is on my wall and I’m going to ask for permission to
   photograph it.  If yes, I’ll post the picture along with Fred’s contact
   info. Or if you’re in North Bay, be sure to ask to about him.

[73]BRIAN JOSEPH GRANDBOIS

   Posted on [74]May 12, 2010 by [75]Monique Hurteau

   FIRST NATIONS ARTIST

   Brian Joseph Grandbois is of Dene Suline (Chipewyan) descent. He was
   raised by his grandparents on the Cold Lake Reserve in North Eastern
   Alberta. Brian was able to learn the rich culture and language of his
   people from his grandparents and other elders.  These teachings
   included the arts and traditional stories that were passed down from
   generation to generation. He was influenced by fellow Cold Lake native
   artists such as Alex Janvier.

   Brian did not limit his experiences and travels to just Dene People,
   but to numerous Native Nations across North America – in Canada, US and
   Mexico.

   His works can be viewed at various native art outlets in western
   Canada.

   [76]Brian and I met when I was at a stand up comedy show (click here to
   read about how we met). We had a chat and the rest took on a life of
   it’s own. We were sitting in a Tim Horton’s when these pictures were
   taken. Some of the paint looks like it was airbrushed but it’s not. As
   Brian told me, “it’s Indian airbrushing!” He dabs acrylic paint on with
   a sponge with such precision…you’d swear it’s airbrushing if you saw it
   up close.
