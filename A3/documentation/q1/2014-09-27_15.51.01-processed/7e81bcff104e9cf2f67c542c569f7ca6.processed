[5]Never Forget

   [6][USS_Arizona_sinking.jpg]
   We remember the attack on Oahu that occurred this day 71 years ago. We
   as a family were fortunate enough to visit Hawaii this summer and pay
   our respects to the warriors who made the ultimate sacrifice for this
   nation at Pearl Harbor. I'll never forget standing on the Arizona
   watching the slow rising of fuel to the surface from a hull that is the
   final resting place for over 1000 sailors. The fuel continues to flow
   as the blood must have seemed to endlessly flow that day.
     [7][john-finn.jpg]
   In 2004 while serving at the Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), I
   was asked by my good friend Gina Savini to check in on a veteran who
   had been admitted to my hospital. Gina had escorted LT John Finn the
   prior day at the dedication of the WWII Memorial in DC. Gina was a Navy
   LCDR and a White House Social Aide. Gina had the privilege of escorting
   the LT, who was 95 at the time, and had fallen the previous evening in
   his hotel room. The opinion of a hospital ER was that some muscles were
   strained and LT Finn was fitted with a wheelchair in order to attend
   the ceremony. Gina was concerned that there was more involved than a
   muscle strain. LT Finn needed to return home to San Diego but Gina
   arranged for his admission to NMCSD on arrival.
   While Gina would have done this for anyone and certainly any veteran,
   LT Finn was no "regular" vet. LT Finn was the first man awarded the
   Medal of Honor in WWII. On Dec 7 1941, during the first attack by
   Japanese airplanes on the Naval Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, LT Finn
   "secured and manned a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on an instruction
   stand in a completely exposed section of the parking ramp, which was
   under heavy enemy machine gun strafing fire. Although painfully wounded
   many times, he continued to man this gun and to return the enemy's fire
   vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and
   bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal
   safety. It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave
   his post to seek medical attention. Following first-aid treatment,
   although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great
   difficulty, he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised
   the rearming of returning planes."
   The LT was admitted to NMCSD. Turns out he had a hairline hip fracture.
   The day he arrived I met him in his room. I knocked, was given
   permission to enter and remember a sense of unworthiness in sharing
   space with this man who had been willing to sacrifice so much for his
   country. After introducing myself and informing the LT why I was there,
   LT Finn asked that I call him John. He introduced me to a friend of his
   in the room, another John, John Baca. John Baca was perhaps a 5-10
   years older than I. John Finn went on to recount the events at the WWII
   Memorial dedication, how much it had meant to him to be there, and how
   important it was to remember fallen comrades. I asked about the events
   of Dec 7th in 1941 and he described them in vivid detail. He reported
   the anger he felt when he realized what was happening that morning. He
   saw good friends die, he saw pilots burned alive as they tried to get
   their planes off the ground. John said it wasn't bravery that day. He
   was just determined to protect the men he served with and those trying
   to launch their aircraft. He described relocating his trusty .50
   caliber machine gun, firing, reloading, firing again. He described
   seeing the faces of Japanese pilots, several of whom he directly fired
   upon and hit. John was adamant. He did what anyone else in his position
   that day would have done.
   Then John Finn looked at me, pointed at John Baca, and said, "Now this
   guy here, he is one of the crazy,
   [8][136687015_john-p-baca---medal-of-honor-recipient-with-the-first-.jp
   g] hero types. He's a hand grenade guy." I asked for clarification.
   "Hand grenade guy?" John Finn said, "Yes CAPT, John here was in
   Vietnam. Go ahead John, show him." John Baca smiled and lifted his
   shirt. His belly and chest were a mass of scar tissue. John Finn
   continued, "John here was out one night on a patrol. VC rolled a hand
   grenade into his position. He took his helemt off, covered it, and laid
   on the helmet. Saved 8 guys. Cost him two years of surgery here at
   Naval Hospital back in 1970. Amazing he lived. You guys did a good job.
   Go ahead John, tell him the story."
   It was as John Finn had reported. John Baca recounted the events of
   that night in the Vietnam jungle back in 1970. Then Sp4c. Baca, of
   Company D, "was serving on a recoilless rifle team during a night
   ambush mission. A platoon from his company was sent to investigate the
   detonation of an automatic ambush device forward of his unit's main
   position and soon came under intense enemy fire from concealed
   positions along the trail. Hearing the heavy firing from the platoon
   position and realizing that his recoilless rifle team could assist the
   members of the besieged patrol, Sp4c. Baca led his team through the
   hail of enemy fire to a firing position within the patrol's defensive
   perimeter. As they prepared to engage the enemy, a fragmentation
   grenade was thrown into the midst of the patrol. Fully aware of the
   danger to his comrades, Sp4c. Baca unhesitatingly, and with complete
   disregard for his own safety, covered the grenade with his steel helmet
   and fell on it as the grenade exploded, thereby absorbing the lethal
   fragments and concussion with his body. His gallant action and total
   disregard for his personal well-being directly saved 8 men from certain
   serious injury or death."
   I have never felt so insignificant and awestruck in my life. I was
   sitting in a Naval hospital room with two Medal of Honor winners. And
   never had I felt so proud in my life. The pride welled from the
   knowledge that I served in the uniform that these heroes had worn years
   ago. I instantly felt unworthy but also felt the unmistakeable,
   unspoken, well earned pride that comes from wearing the uniform of the
   United States military.
   I thank God for the blessing of that day. I pray that on this day that
   should live in infamy, that none of us ever forgets that we live in one
   of the few nations on earth that can produce men and women like this. I
   further pray that none of us ever forgets the incredible sacrifice made
   every day by incredible men and women who volunteer to wear that
   uniform in order to provide the blanket of freedom which we sleep under
   every night.

[13]Distorting Abortion

     Great News!!! The [14]CDC abortion rate fell 5% in 2009!

     This is great news, isn't it?
   [15][u7938qh8ul.jpg]
   Well, you can't tell from the LA Times and CDC comments. The CDC
   concludes this drop in "abortion rates might be influenced by a lack of
   availability of abortion providers, state laws, the general economy and
   access to health services including contraception." Sure doesn't seem
   that the CDC sees abortion like Hillary Clinton does...something that
   should be safe, legal and rare. No mention by the CDC that this drop in
   abortion rates might be due to women, and men, exercising their right
   to not engage in risky sexual behavior. Wait, is that a right? I may be
   confused. It's possible that only engaging in risky sexual behavior
   without the "punishment" of a baby is a right.
   Nevertheless, the CDC resists connecting two other salient facts from
   its own reporting. The LA times simply chooses to distort them. The
   [16]National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), sponsored by the CDC, the
   primary national source of data on unintended pregnancy in the United
   States, shows that from 2006–2010 NSFGs contraceptive use among women
   at risk for unintended pregnancy has decreased. During the same period
   the CDC reports that the the rate of teen pregnancies has dropped
   significantly. In fact, despite reports of less contraceptive use, the
   CDC reports that the rate of [17]teen pregnancy dropped 10% from
   2009-2010.

   [18][truth-signs.jpg]

   The LA Times presentation of this data is stunning. The Times reports
   the drop in abortion rates then goes on to cite the statistics from
   Mississippi which had the lowest state abortion rate, at 4 per 1,000
   women of child-bearing age. The LA times states, "The state
   (Mississippi) also had only a couple of abortion providers and has the
   nation's highest teen birthrate." The LA times would, it seems, expect
   us to conclude that as a result of the lowest abortion rate in the
   country, teen pregnancy is raging in Mississippi. Amazingly, what the
   LA times deceptively fails to report is that the US has seen dramatic
   reductions in teen pregnancy over the last several years, and
   [19]Mississippi is one of the CDC's top 16 states for reductions in
   teen pregnancy!! Yes, Mississippi has the highest teen pregnancy rate
   in the nation, but this rate has dropped 21% over the last three
   years!! I'm sure this truth was just an oversight by the fair and
   balanced staff of the LA Times.
   Word to the disappointed purveyors and proponents of contraception and
   abortion, an objective view of CDC pregnancy data for the last decade
   suggests something amazing might be happening. Women, especially
   teenagers, are reducing the incidence of unwanted pregnancies, and it
   appears to be occurring in the face of a reduction of abortion services
   and the use of contraception. Could it be that increasing numbers of
   men and women, as a a result of education, spiritual enlightenment, the
   economy, legislation and other factors have seriously considered the
   choices they make regarding sexual activity? Wouldn't it be wonderful
   if increasing numbers of Americans, without the need for pills or a
   variety of contraceptive devices, abstained from sex until they were
   married, in a committed relationship or at least were in a position to
   financially support a child?
   [20][itsabout.jpg] If the left really cared about the health and
   welfare of women, they would be rejoicing, not distorting the hopeful
   message of these statistics. That is not the case, however. Abortion
   and contraception are critical sacraments in a church whose survival
   rests on the degradation of traditional Western values. The family and
   marriage are cornerstones of a society whose foundation is built on
   belief in a Creator who has endowed us with unalienable rights. When we
   as a people are stripped of the security, hope and courage which
   unavoidably accompanies our faithful adherence to Judeo-Christian
   tradition, when we accept that men are their own gods, and then in[21]
   [fedplaza.jpg] our hours of need realize we are not gods and confront
   our frailty, and require external support, where will we turn? Having
   banished any notion of divine providence from the public square we will
   then be certified, card carrying parishioners in the Church of
   Liberalism. Then, in our time of distress, we will offer sacrifice and
   penance at the altar of the state. We will pray to the only god we
   know. We will implore the state shepherds to see us as respectable
   sheep worthy of their beneficence and generosity.
   The LA times and CDC are doing their part to make certain we are all
   properly conditioned for the state sheepfold.

[26]Letter to a Young Mom Asking For Another View After Conversation with a
Liberal Acquaintance Rob (on the then Presidential candidacy of Barack Obama
in 2008) Part IV of IV

   Letter to a Young Mom Asking For Another View After Conversation with a
   Liberal Acquaintance Rob (on the then Presidential candidacy of Barack
   Obama in 2008) Part IV of IV
   Summary
   In the end Young Mom, this is a choice between support for individual
   liberty or increasing concentration of power in the state.  John McCain
   supports a government that recognizes its limitations in securing life,
   liberty and pursuit of happiness for its people.  Senator Obama
   believes that the government should be the source of that happiness.
   The liberal fascism of Senator Obama is smiley face fascism.  Senator
   Obama sees the state as the principal force in the lives of American
   citizens.  He would have the state control your healthcare, education,
   energy production, and finances.  Senator McCain proposes a state that
   protects the right of an individual to life (certainly after they are
   born), ensures the security of the United States, and provides
   individuals the ability to make choices in their healthcare, finances,
   and education.  Senator Obama has built his campaign on class warfare,
   promising wealth redistribution through tax increases (on the “rich)
   and tax credits (for the 40% of Americans not paying taxes) which
   cannot be supported based on his proposed spending.  The last person to
   take an economy the likes which we are currently experiencing and
   employ the economic practices Senator Obama advocates was Herbert
   Hoover.  Hoover’s policies quickly thrust America into the Great
   Depression.
   John McCain has served his nation nobly during war and peace.  His
   military service is well documented.  His legislative history is one of
   determination to form alliances and move legislation in a bipartisan
   manner.  Honestly, this has been much to my chagrin.  I have completely
   disagreed with him on some of these efforts…McCain-Feingold,
   McCain-Kennedy and McCain-Lieberman.  His leadership on Iraq, however,
   has been impressive, and his commitment to reform spending in DC is
   critical at this time.  Barack Obama has no serious accomplishments to
   speak of.  He appears to have been at best a mediocre community
   organizer.  He rose through the ranks of Chicago politics through the
   mentorship of a number of unsavory sponsors, including Wright, Pfleger,
   Ayers, Dohrn, Rezko, and Meeks.  He was undistinguished as an Illinois
   legislator and remains so as a US Senator.  Despite lofty claims, he
   has never demonstrated a willingness to reach across the aisle on
   anything of significance.  Senator Obama votes with his party 97% of
   the time.  In addition he has the distinction of being the most liberal
   Senator in the Senate.  This is quite an accomplishment.  Senator Obama
   is even left of Bernie Sanders, the only avowed socialist in the
   Senate.  No doubt Senator Obama is capable of delivering soaring
   oratory and is a good debater, but what qualifies him for the
   Presidency Young Mom?
   While there are enough differences in core philosophy for most
   Americans to arrive at a preference amongst these two candidates, there
   is another critical factor at play here.  Character matters in choosing
   a President.   Neither McCain nor Obama is a perfect man.  However,
   there is a staggering lack of transparency on the part of the Obama
   candidacy.  Senator Obama has weaved a tangled web of radical
   associations over the course of his life.  How can it be that there is
   a twenty year gap in significant knowledge about the activities of
   Senator Obama from his time at Occidental to his time in the Illinois
   legislature?  This man wants to be President.  We have a right to know
   this history.
   Rob reports words and deeds do matter.  Rob says, however, he has seen
   nor heard nothing from Senator Obama that “insinuates that his views on
   patriotism were informed by Ayers, or his views on race were informed
   by Jeremiah Wright, or his views on politics by ACORN.”  Senator Obama
   has attempted to make his own race an issue numerous times in this
   campaign, not John McCain.  Senator Obama has stated that "there's no
   doubt that when it comes to our treatment of Native Americans as well
   as other persons of color in this country, we've got some very sad and
   difficult things to account for," and he has described his grandmother
   as a “typical white person” regarding a comment she made which he felt
   was racist.  This is in addition to spending twenty years in a BLT
   church, giving ACORN $800,000 and describing our military efforts in
   Afghanistan as “air raiding villages and killing innocent civilians.”
   That’s for starters.  I’m not exactly sure what would need to be said
   to Rob to provide evidence that Senator Obama has some serious
   explaining to do regarding radical tendencies and character concerns.
   So what we do know is disturbing enough, and if there is nothing to
   hide, why will Senator Obama not fully detail and release records
   related to two decades of his life?  More importantly, why has the
   media not done its duty and properly vetted Senator Obama?  Added to
   character concerns is the thuggish conduct of the Obama campaign,
   including support of ACORN and questionable campaign financing
   practices.
   Rob reports that Senator Obama is “visionary”, “even tempered”,
   “charismatic” and has a “transformative will on domestic and global
   issues”.  Where are the Obama accomplishments that support any of these
   assertions?  Rob offers no support for such lofty descriptors.  That
   said, it is somewhat disconcerting that the qualities noted by Rob have
   been shared by the great liberal fascist leaders of the past…Woodrow
   Wilson, Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao.  All proposed state centered
   solutions which sacrificed individual liberty on the state altar, some
   literally, some figuratively.
   There is much to consider in this election, and the bias of mainstream
   media makes it essential that voters use all information sources
   available to them.  Cruising the candidate’s websites, as Rob
   recommends, is informative.  The thoughtful voter needs to do much
   more, however.  Liberal views are endlessly streamed in the mainstream
   media on newsstands, in airports, and on major networks.  If you want
   balance Young Mom,  add Fox News to your regular cable lineup.  Despite
   what liberal bloggers at Daily Kos and Huffington Post may say, Fox is
   balanced; it might appear relatively conservative to some when measured
   against the liberal skew from other media outlets.  Consider visiting
   some of the sites referenced in this letter.  My hope is that you have
   the opportunity to give your vote the consideration it deserves.  Time
   is short, however, and in this election voters will make a momentous
   judgment in the course they wish America to take.
   This election, Young Mom, is a contest between well defined ideologies,
   conservatism and socialism.  Both candidates have made their positions
   clear.  We all have a choice to make.  We may elect to reject the
   tradition that has made this nation great, a tradition committed to the
   pursuit of individual liberty, free society, free markets and a
   constitutional republic which recognizes limits of the power of
   government.  Some may choose a vision which views the state as the
   arbiter of all rights and societal well being.  History is replete with
   examples of what leaders of states do when afforded this opportunity.
   When all power is handed to the state, although technically composed of
   individuals, the state takes on a life of its own.  The state
   reflexively seeks greater extremes of control. Young Mom, the socialist
   tendencies of Barrack Obama will find no modulation in potentially the
   most liberal Congress this nation has ever known.    Ultimately,
   socialism seeks the destruction of democracy.  It may come in the form
   of a smiley face, offering great oratory, but it seeks an absolute
   monarchy of power.
   Senator Obama has framed his campaign as one that fights for legitimate
   aims, while the defenders of democracy and the republic are painted as
   repressive reactionaries.  He has attempted to picture his campaign as
   one with the forces of progress, legitimacy and even peace, while
   trying to discredit and paralyze the citizens who are only trying to
   preserve our tradition and heritage.  In Senator Obama we are offered a
   candidate with no executive accomplishments, no demonstrated leadership
   ability, a history of radical and anti-American relationships, a career
   built on old time, corrupt Chicago politics, a socialist vision for the
   United States and a worldview which minimizes or ignores the
   significant strategic challenges facing us today.
   Young Mom, as a conservative, I can tell you that John McCain was not
   my first choice for a Republican candidate.  He is a good and honest
   man though.  He has sacrificed much for his country.  He understands
   the foundation this nation was built on and he advocates principled
   solutions that are in keeping with that foundation.  John McCain is
   determined to make sure that our children continue to enjoy the same
   liberties and freedoms we have been blessed with in this greatest of
   nations.  In the challenging times before us America needs a leader who
   understands the difficult choices a democracy must make to sustain its
   existence.  Only a tiny minority of the human race has ever experienced
   democracy.  This grand experiment in our nation has only existed for a
   little over two hundred years, and is hardly a historical footnote.  My
   prayer is that conscientious voters will consider the internal and
   external threats to this great American experiment.  From Thomas Paine,
   “What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.”
   As American citizens, we are the beneficiaries of a harvest reaped from
   the sacrifices of generations gone before us.  Should this dream be
   wagered on the bankrupt political philosophy of a mediocre community
   organizer?  Or should we entrust this dream to an American patriot
   whose life is built on service to his nation and a realization that the
   “cause of America is, in a great measure, the cause of all mankind?”
   I pray we choose wisely.

   Letter to a Young Mom Asking For Another View After Conversation with a
   Liberal Acquaintance Rob (on the then Presidential candidacy of Barack
   Obama in 2008) Part III

   Energy and Healthcare
   Young Mom, Rob did not review these issues in any detail.  They are,
   however, crucial.  The price of energy has enormous repercussions for
   each of us every day.  It is not just what we pay at the pump.  Fuel
   costs, like corporate tax rates, are part of businesses doing business
   and are passed down to us in increased cost for food, services and
   necessary items for daily living.  Energy is also a national security
   issue.  We send $800,000,000, 000 a year to oil producing nations,
   several of whom are sponsors of the Jihadist movement bent on our
   destruction.
   Senator McCain has outlined a realistic energy plan that supports all
   alternative fuel developments, but also realizes alternative energy is
   not an immediate answer to our problems.  McCain supports programs
   which will make it possible to build nuclear reactors ASAP.  Eighty
   percent (80%) of French electricity is supplied by nuclear reactors.
   In the US, 20% of our energy is from nuclear.  This is because
   environmentalists have carried the day and despite the record of safety
   in nuclear power, they have convinced many of the American people and
   legislators that nuclear is not safe.  Similarly we have not built an
   oil refinery in this nation for twenty years and oil companies are
   unable to drill some of the lands they now have access to due to
   environmental regulation.  We have not built a nuclear reactor in this
   country since 1996.
   Senator McCain realizes that for the next 20 years at least, we will
   require oil to drive our economy.  Should we attempt to become oil
   independent?  Yes.  Both candidates agree on this.  Senator Obama says
   we can be “off oil” in ten years.  This means no gas powered
   transportation or home heating in ten years, but is this possible?
   Denmark is perhaps the most advanced nation in pursuit of alternative
   energy.  Denmark has invested in wind technology for twenty years.
   Despite enormous investment and the most vigorous wind industry on the
   planet, this small nation is only able to derive 20% of power from
   wind; and the wind power they have has been costly and it is very
   unreliable.  Denmark has not kicked the oil habit.  Based on
   population, consumes oil at half of the current level of US oil
   consumption.  Denmark remains dependent on oil, the difference is they
   do not import it, they drill for it.
   Denmark aggressively drills for oil in the North Sea.  They have
   drastically cut their oil imports by building an oil industry which
   exports more than it consumes.  What are those of us out here seeing
   gas and food prices go up supposed to do Young Mom while President
   Obama attempts to force a green dream on us which has not been
   attainable in twenty years for an extremely small, committed European
   state?  Senator Obama has said he believes gas prices should go up, not
   too fast, but that we should pay more for oil and gas.  He has said
   this pain is necessary in order for us to become less dependent on
   oil.  He believes we should be paying more for gas.  In pursuit of his
   goal of weaning us from oil, Senator Obama has supported everything
   possible to make sure there is no chance the price of gas will drop.
   He has opposed any domestic oil drilling legislation that would result
   in more oil coming out of the ground and he wants to institute a
   windfall profit tax oil companies.  The result of that will be the same
   as other corporate tax increases.  Oil companies will pass the tax on
   to us and ultimately, as happened under Jimmy Carter when he instituted
   a similar tax in 1980, oil production will drop.  In the meantime
   Senator Obama will levy taxes to support green energy sources.  This is
   part of Senator Obama’s vision to develop an energy industry supported
   by the state.
   The problem is, Young Mom, the nation in the world most committed to
   this process has over twenty years only managed to generate twenty five
   percent total of its energy from non-carbon sources.  If this much
   smaller nation of 5 million people, totally committed to this process
   still needs oil, who in their right mind believes we, a nation of
   300,000,000 will eliminate a need for oil in ten years?  Yes, we can
   and should try, but we need a leader who recognizes the realities of
   energy and who will build the bridges required in a thoughtful energy
   independence plan.  This means recognizing that we have tremendous
   untapped oil reserves and that irrational environmental concerns have
   severely limited our ability to pursue a variety of energy sources.  We
   can safely drill.  We can build a self reliant oil industry (as Denmark
   has done).  We need nuclear power and fast tracking of plants, not
   hesitation and double talk from Senator Obama on what we will do with
   reactor fuel.  France does this for goodness sake Young Mom!  We need
   clean coal, but despite what Nancy Pelosi thinks, this is a carbon
   fuel.  And yes, we need alternative sources, but it is socialist and
   tyrannical to presume that the state should punish citizens and the
   economy with unnecessary oil and gas costs in its pursuit of a utopian
   vision of energy which even the most determined European states have
   been unable to achieve.
   Exxon made 40 billion on sales of $404 billion dollars in 2007 Young
   Mom, roughly a 10% net profit on sales.  They are lots of costs which
   go into running an oil business, something those warring on big oil
   rarely talk about.  That said, 10% profit is not bad, though not as
   good as Microsoft.  Exxon didn't hit the lottery though, the government
   did.  For all the sales taxes, duties and income taxes collected, the
   government pulled in a $102 billion on Exxon's sales of $404 billion.
   Young Mom, nearly 25% of all of Exxon's sales (not profit, sales!) goes
   to some governmental entity!  Increases or sustained elevations in the
   price of gas will have devastating effect during the economic tailspin
   many believe will result from Obama economic policies.  As we pump gas
   we cannot afford during a possible Obama Presidency, paying $5 or more
   a gallon, we all must remember that the government puts $1.00 in its
   pockets, the oil company keeps $0.50.
   As a physician it is clear to me that the Obama health plan clearly
   puts us on the road to nationalized healthcare.  Some may disagree with
   the approach, I just wish the Senator would honestly state his
   intention.  He believes we need government control over the healthcare
   system.  Many agree.  The driver in this discussion is the oft repeated
   statement that 47,000,000 are uninsured.  First, this does not mean
   these people have no healthcare.  In fact, everyone in this country can
   show up at the emergency room and get healthcare.  When this group is
   analyzed one finds that a third are eligible for Medicaid but are not
   signed up, a third could possibly afford healthcare insurance but have
   made the decision not to purchase it and a third need real assistance
   in getting on an established  plan.
   Senator McCain proposes giving individuals choice in choosing
   healthcare, and offers monetary assistance to do so.  He proposes a tax
   credit of $5000 for families purchasing healthcare on their own.
   Senator Obama has been erroneously advertising that voters will lose
   health benefits and money under the McCain health plan.  Senator Obama
   is portraying the McCain move to consumer driven health as workers
   getting a $5,000 tax credit, health insurance costing $12,000 per
   family, and the worker getting stuck with a $7,000 bill.  Right?
   Wrong!  Here’s how it would really work. Suppose a worker gets $50,000
   in cash wages and $12,000 in health insurance. Right now, he pays
   federal income taxes on the wages but not the health insurance. Let’s
   assume, for reasons of simplicity, that the tax rate he is paying is a
   flat 25% on his wages. He therefore pays $12,500 in federal income
   taxes. His after-tax, after-health-care income is $37,500. Now, under
   the McCain plan, his employer keeps paying the premium, which is now
   counted as income to the worker. He therefore pays federal income taxes
   on $62,000, or $15,500.  But he also gets a tax credit of $5,000 for
   health insurance, which means that, all in all, he owes $10,500 in
   federal taxes, or $2,000 less than he does today. His after-tax,
   after-health-care income is $39,500. If the worker decides to buy his
   insurance in the open market instead of through the employer, the
   result will be the same. His employer is indifferent to how he pays his
   worker as long as total costs are the same. So instead of paying
   premiums, the employer pays his worker $62,000 in cash wages and does
   not pay anything toward insurance. The worker again owes $15,500 in
   taxes on this compensation, and he also must buy health insurance
   costing $12,000. So, his pre-tax income is $62,000, he owes $12,000 in
   health insurance premiums, and he owes $10,500 in federal taxes (after
   claiming his credit). His after-tax, after-health-care income is the
   same: $39,500 ($62,000 – $12,000 – $10,500), or $2,000 more than today.
   This plan would be a break even or slight cost to wealthier taxpayers.
   McCain would also eliminate restrictions on purchase of healthcare
   insurance across state lines.  Many states have enacted healthcare
   mandates for insurance policies which have driven the cost of insurance
   through the roof for all.  Perhaps you don’t want an insurance plan
   that covers the cost of cosmetic plastic surgery or artificial
   reproductive technologies.  You have the choice in the McCain system to
   purchase a plan which meets your needs.  You keep the amount of money
   left over and there will be money left over for most Americans.
   Senator Obama proposes a National Health Insurance Exchange which will
   create a government mandated benefit for all.  He reports that you can
   keep your current plan and doctor, but follows on with reporting that
   those employers who do not offer the plan proposed by the Exchange will
   be fined.  He refuses to state what the fine, or “incentive” for
   employers to join the Insurance Exchange will be.  He most recently
   refused to discuss this issue in the last debate with John McCain.
   Young Mom, as a healthcare provider I have great concern with Senator
   Obama’s healthcare plan.  It will force individuals and employers into
   a health care benefit managed by the government.  The results of such
   experiments in healthcare, socialized medicine adventures, are visible
   throughout Europe and in Canada.  Costs have continued to rise and cost
   containment, at the expense of quality, becomes the only course of
   action for governments committed to offering a one size fits all
   solution for individual health care.  The government approach presumes
   the government is best suited to determine   what health benefit
   everyone needs.  Senator Obama says that he simply wants all Americans
   to have the same benefit legislators have, the Federal Employees Health
   Benefit Program (FEHBP).  We need to discuss the FEHBP.
   Young Mom, the FEHBP is not a described benefit, though that is how
   Senator Obama presents it.  This year, 283 plans are available through
   the FEHBP at the national and local levels. The benefit packages change
   from year to year— sometimes dramatically—depending on prevailing
   market conditions, consumer demand, and insurers' willingness to
   compete and offer different packages through the FEHBP.  This wide
   range of personal choices and the intense competition among the various
   health plans are precisely what make the FEBHP both popular and
   successful. It is the closest thing that Americans—at least those
   Americans who work for the federal government—have to a functioning,
   consumer-driven national health insurance market.
   The Obama plan has nothing to do with such choice and plan
   competition.  Despite Senator Obama's rhetoric of "choice and
   competition," his plan is a vehicle for new regulations and federal
   power that would leave ordinary Americans with even less control of
   their health care dollars than they exercise today.  As a parent and
   physician Young Mom, the Obama plan is bad medicine.
   Instead of using the massive power of the federal government to impose
   a top-down change on the health care system, Senator Obama and other
   policymakers would be wise to transfer direct control of health care
   dollars to individuals and families. Senator McCain’s plan recognizes
   that this would enable Americans to exercise real personal choice of
   health plans and benefits while making health plans and providers
   compete directly for consumers' dollars by providing value to patients.
   The War against Jihadism, National Security and Homeland Defense
   Rob leaves on the table several other important topics which you as a
   Young Mom should consider carefully in selecting the next Commander in
   Chief.  We are currently engaged in a war with Jihadists and radical
   Muslims around the world.  Despite what Senator Obama says, we did not
   ask for this conflict.  The game was clearly on in 1979 with the taking
   of the American Embassy in Iran, but has roots even earlier than that.
   Despite this, the United States has been the greatest provider of
   financial aid to developing Muslim nations worldwide.  I would suggest
   this has not always been wise policy but US economic aid to Egypt,
   Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey dwarfs that
   supplied by any other nations.  We have been the savior for millions of
   Muslims worldwide not only through economic aid but through military
   support.  We have sacrificed our most precious treasure to protect
   Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan from control by tyrannical regimes bent
   not only on our destruction but the torture and destruction of their
   own people.
   Senator Obama would have you look upon the military as a needy special
   interest group sacrificed in meaningless imperial adventures.  Talk to
   military members who have served in those arenas Young Mom.  Military
   members are proud of the service we have performed worldwide to ensure
   the safety of our nation.   In performing this duty we have also
   created safe space for people around the world to attempt the
   experiment which has been successful here.
   The war we are engaged in now concerned mom has multiple fronts.  It is
   in Iraq, Afghanistan and may be elsewhere in the future.  Senator
   McCain recognizes the vicious enemy before us and the global conflict
   we are engaged in.  Senator Obama does not.  He sees separate
   individual conflicts.  Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq.  Well
   Young Mom, you would never know it from the cricket sounds in
   newsrooms, but we are winning and very likely have won the war there.
   Camp Fallujah was closed this week.  You didn’t read it in the NY Times
   or hear about it on the nightly news.  There is nothing left for
   Marines and Army members to do in Anbar province.  We have begun
   bringing troops home.  This is happening because John McCain supported
   General Petraeus’ strategy of counterinsurgency and demanded the
   surge.  McCain defied the Bush administration, criticized war planning
   and demanded a different approach.  It has worked spectacularly.
   Senator Obama said the surge would not work and would make things
   worse.  He demanded withdrawal on a timetable which would have given AQ
   in Iraq a light at the end of the tunnel.  There are many who would
   argue about whether we should have gone.  There were many good reasons;
   enough reasons in fact that the Senate authorized this conflict
   (77-23).  Senator Obama reports he was against the war.  Fact is, he
   was not in the Senate at the time.  It is easy to be in the State
   Senate and say such things.  Do you believe Senator Obama would have
   voted differently than Clinton, Kerry or his running mate Biden?  The
   fact is, like it or not, we remain at war with Islamofascism and we are
   in Iraq.
   The approach advocated by John McCain took courage.  He defied his
   party in being critical of the war effort.  McCain knows we are engaged
   in a multi front war and that to lose the Iraq battle would have been a
   disaster for many.  The Obama approach would have been a victory for
   Islamofascism.  It has also been reported that on his recent world tour
   Senator Obama, while in Iraq, asked PM Maliki to [30]delay US troop
   withdrawal. Per the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Senator Obama reportedly
   told Maliki that when a new administration came on board, they should
   be the ones to coordinate such a withdrawal.  If Senator Obama believes
   so firmly in withdrawal, shouldn’t he be celebrating the fact that it
   is safe to bring some troops home now?  The cynic would say no, he
   wants to take credit for that himself if he is elected.  The fact is
   that the only reason anyone will be coming home in an orderly fashion
   and the Iraqis have a chance at stability is that the Petraeus strategy
   has secured the country.  Such conversation by Senator Obama also
   displays a despicable disregard for the safety of our troops.  If it is
   safe to bring them home, do so.  Maintaining deployed forces, even if
   not actively engaged in battle, is a hardship on military members and
   families which is endured as long as it is required.  In addition,
   requesting that Maliki keep US forces in place until a possible Obama
   Presidency is realized puts military lives at risk.
   Young Mom, the world views of the two Presidential candidates men are
   polar opposites.  Senator Obama sees the United States as needing to
   assume its place in the larger world community as another member.  He
   sees the United States as a big part of the world’s problems.  Senator
   McCain sees the US as a world leader who must work with other nations,
   maintain alliances, but retain our ability to function independently in
   our best interests.  Senator McCain sees the United States as a big
   part of the solution to the world’s problems.  Obama believes, much as
   Neville Chamberlain did in the 1930s, that our enemies are reasonable
   people who can be talked with, or at least bought off.  While Senator
   Obama and the media would have us all believe the US has not spoken
   with rogue nations which concern us most, President Bush’s
   administration has held talks with Iran, North Korea and Venezuela.  We
   have encouraged European allies to take the lead on Iranian
   negotiations.  They asked for this responsibility.  The President of
   the United States should never walk into such dens of snakes without
   clear pre-conditions and expectations.  Senator Obama has stated
   clearly that he would meet “without preconditions” with top leaders in
   nations determined to destroy us and our allies.  McCain has made clear
   he will meet with anyone when the time and conditions are right.
   Young Mom, the Senator Obama national security and worldview is naïve
   and  dangerous.  Leaders of the worst of nations and terrorist
   movements (Venezuela, Iran, Hamas, North Korea) have espoused their
   support for Senator Obama.  Do you think that is because he will insist
   that they conform to accepted standards of behavior for modern
   governments?  When Senator Obama says “Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these
   countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a
   serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us,” he
   reveals a staggering lack of understanding of the ideology of these
   nations’ leaders.  These rogue nations with emerging nuclear
   capability, have all demonstrated a commitment to supporting
   terrorism.  They are unstable and irrational, unlike the USSR, and have
   the potential to lethally impact democratic nations  crippled by
   political correctness with relatively open borders.
   In his note to you Young Mom, Rob does not even mention national
   security or the war on Jihadism as an issue which he feels will impact
   his family’s future.  Simply amazing in this day and age.  This is the
   world view, however, of those wearing liberal eyeshades. Despite the
   continual escalation of a war against the West over the last thirty
   years, liberals refuse to recognize the enemy.  Some of our allies do,
   however.  This is from Geert Wilders, Chairman of the Party for Freedom
   in the Netherlands, speaking to America:
   I come to America with a mission. All is not well in the old world.
   There is a tremendous danger looming, and it is very difficult to be
   optimistic. We might be in the final stages of the Islamization of
   Europe. This not only is a clear and present danger to the future of
   Europe itself, it is a threat to America and the sheer survival of the
   West. The danger I see looming is the scenario of America as the last
   man standing. The United States as the last bastion of Western
   civilization, facing an Islamic Europe. In a generation or two, the US
   will ask itself: who lost Europe? Patriots from around Europe risk
   their lives every day to prevent precisely this scenario form becoming
   a reality.
   Dear friends, liberty is the most precious of gifts. My generation
   never had to fight for this freedom, it was offered to us on a silver
   platter, by people who fought for it with their lives. All throughout
   Europe American cemeteries remind us of the young boys who never made
   it home, and whose memory we cherish. My generation does not own this
   freedom; we are merely its custodians. We can only hand over this hard
   won liberty to Europe’s children in the same state in which it was
   offered to us. We cannot strike a deal with mullahs and imams. Future
   generations would never forgive us. We cannot squander our liberties.
   We simply do not have the right to do so.
   This is not the first time our civilization is under threat. We have
   seen dangers before. We have been betrayed by our elites before. They
   have sided with our enemies before. And yet, then, freedom prevailed.
   These are not times in which to take lessons from appeasement,
   capitulation, giving away, giving up or giving in. These are not times
   in which to draw lessons from Mr. Chamberlain. These are times calling
   us to draw lessons from Mr. Churchill and the words he spoke in 1942:
   “Never give in, never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small,
   large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good
   sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming
   might of the enemy”.
   As you weigh your vote Young Mom, you must give serious thought to
   considering who should assume the role of Commander in Chief.  Joe
   Biden made some disturbing comments about what faces us in an Obama
   Presidency:
   "Mark my words," the Democratic vice presidential nominee warned at the
   second of his two Seattle fundraisers Sunday. "It will not be six
   months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy.
   The world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old
   senator president of the United States of America. Remember I said it
   standing here if you don't remember anything else I said. Watch, we're
   gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the
   mettle of this guy."

   "I can give you at least four or five scenarios from where it might
   originate," Biden said to Emerald City supporters, mentioning the
   Middle East and Russia as possibilities. "And he's gonna need help. And
   the kind of help he's gonna need is, he's gonna need you - not
   financially to help him - we're gonna need you to use your influence,
   your influence within the community, to stand with him. Because it's
   not gonna be apparent initially, it's not gonna be apparent that we're
   right."

   Joe Biden almost bluntly declares here that a President Obama will
   invite challenges from enemies abroad.  If Obama power diplomacy is
   going to be so effective, why will this happen?  Senator Obama tells
   us, “if America is willing to come to the table, the world will be more
   willing to rally behind American leadership to deal with challenges
   like terrorism, and Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs.”  I don’t
   know about you Young Mom, but Biden’s comments are shocking to me.  The
   VP on the Dem ticket, who in debates said about Obama and his ability
   to be President, "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't
   believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to
   on-the-job training", warns us that a President Obama will react to the
   coming crisis in a way that demoralizes the country and which shatters
   public confidence in Obama.
    Young Mom, no one is suggesting this would happen under a President
   McCain.  There will be no rush by our enemies to challenge a President
   McCain.  Why, because he is committed to protecting our nation and our
   allies.  Why would thoughtful voters ever consider casting a ballot for
   a Senator Obama when his VP, someone familiar with foreign affairs,
   predicts a calamity within the first six months of an Obama
   Presidency?  Young Mom, I want to elect someone who will be equipped to
   prevent such an occurrence.  When even Joe Biden tells you that
   disaster awaits the first six months of an  Obama Presidency, we should
   listen.  There's no way to deny the reality of the defeatism and
   retreat represented by a vote for Obama and which our enemies see in a
   President Obama.
   John McCain has led a thoroughly examined life which has been ruled by
   honor and what he has judged to be good sense.  He is not a man who
   wavers, not a man who will ever compromise the security of this nation
   to any enemy. Rob and most liberals believe the forces committed to the
   destruction of Western civilization are an exaggerated figment of
   Republicans’ imaginations.  You will have to form your own opinions
   about this Young Mom, but there is no doubt that the next President
   will have to make vital national security decisions that will have
   enormous repercussions for future generations.
   The Stealth Candidate
   As you consider your next Commander in Chief Young Mom, you should be
   aware of an important fact.  Senator Obama, if he were a civilian
   applying for secret, or even top secret clearance, would be denied.
   Senator Obama could not work as a civilian at Lockheed or at the White
   House.  I have been through the clearance drill and know others
   involved in this process at the White House.  Senator Obama would be
   denied not because he has a funny name and not because of his color.
   The mainstream media has done this nation an enormous disservice in
   vetting Senator Obama.  I would highly recommend reading Senator
   Obama’s books, Dreams From My Father and Audacity of Hope.  They are
   fascinating reading and offer some interesting insights into Senator
   Obama’s thought process and his struggle for identity.  Perhaps most
   importantly, this is the only detailed accounting we have of the
   Senator’s activities over a twenty year period (1979-1999).  Senator
   McCain’s life is an open book.  During his twenties McCain was being
   tortured in a POW camp, Senator Obama by his own account (Dreams) was
   attending school, socializing with radicals at Occidental and then
   Columbia, and doing drugs.  Senator Obama has NEVER talked about why he
   went from Occidental to Columbia, what his relationship was with
   Pakistani students at Occidental, how same students influenced him to
   move to New York, why he took several extended trips to Pakistan while
   in school, what the details were of his decision to go to Chicago, did
   he meet Bill Ayers while at Columbia, how did a very average student
   got into Harvard Law first time around, and exactly how was all this
   paid for?
   Senator Obama has a laundry list of documents he has either refused to
   produce or actively obstructed distribution of.  These include all
   transcripts from all colleges and law school, theses from all colleges
   and law school, birth certificate (not certificate of live
   birth...there are many stories from his Kenyan family that he was born
   in Kenya while his mom was there, not Hawaii), passports, college loan
   documents, selective service registration, Illinois state senate
   schedule and agendas, client list from his time at law firms in
   Chicago, and medical records.
   So, no secret clearance would be granted without releasing all these
   records.  No secret clearance would be approved with a history illegal
   drug use.   No clearance with an established record of consorting with
   known criminals and terrorists.  Three strikes, and you don’t get three
   strikes when applying for secret clearance.  This might not mean much
   to those who have not been involved in the military or national
   security work.  To those who have spent time in these areas, the
   thought of a President who never served in the military (understood
   many future President’s will not), who will not produce his selective
   service registration (making one wonder if Senator Obama is registered)
   and who could not meet the requirements for clearance, is
   incomprehensible.
   Rob, attempts to dismiss Senator Obama’s friendship with William Ayers
   as attempting to paint Senator Obama unfairly with the radical brush.
   If one is to believe Rob, then Senator Obama is an absolute incompetent
   and imbecile.  Rob is asking for the willful suspension of disbelief.
   He suggests that it is unreasonable to believe that two men share core
   values when Senator Obama took his first executive job from Ayers,
   served the Ayers project for six years, served with Ayers on other
   boards and decided to launch his first political campaign from the
   Ayers living room.
   Rob is correct that Bill Ayers is only one part of the patchwork of
   mentors, friends and associates that form the Obama cloak of
   radicalism.  Jeremiah Wright, as the former pastor of Trinity United
   Church, a church Obama attended for twenty years, preached the gospel
   according to black liberation theology (BLT) from his pulpit.  BLT,
   according to James Cone (a mentor for Wright), one of its founders, has
   written, “Black theology will accept only the love of God which
   participates in the destruction of the white enemy. What we need is the
   divine love as expressed in Black Power, which is the power of black
   people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their
   disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must
   reject his love.”  Rob is not telling the truth Young Mom when he says
   this was never preached from the pulpit.  Pretty much all of the vile
   bile spewed by Jeremiah Wright was done from the pulpit, much like
   other Obama minister friends (Pfleger, Meeks).  Rob must not think you
   have access to You Tube, but check out this one of many videos of
   infamous [31]Wright performances.  The word according to Rev. Wright:
    “The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a
   three-strike law and then wants us to sing ‘God Bless America.’ No, no,
   no, God damn America, that’s in the Bible for killing innocent people.
   God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn
   America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.”
   (2003)
   Most of the available tape of Jeremiah Wright is from the pulpit.  What
   is truly astounding is that Trinity has maintained its tax status as a
   non-profit organization.  That should have been stripped away years
   ago.  Rob says that Wright never preached hate from the pulpit.  He
   says that it is inconceivable that Trinity could be a racist
   anti-American institution.  In fact, looking at the tapes of Wright and
   the reaction of the crowd, it is not at all hard to imagine that what
   Rob denies is fact.  Rob describes Wright as the person who brought
   Obama to Christ.  Obama has written regarding his belief that the black
   churches would play a critical in developing a political power base.
   From
   [32]Obama::

   "Nowhere is the promise of organizing more apparent than in the
   traditional black churches. Possessing tremendous financial resources,
   membership and — most importantly — values and biblical traditions that
   call for empowerment and liberation, the black church is clearly a
   slumbering giant in the political and economic landscape of cities like
   Chicago. A fierce independence among black pastors and a preference for
   more traditional approaches to social involvement (supporting
   candidates for office, providing shelters for the homeless) have
   prevented the black church from bringing its full weight to bear on the
   political, social and economic arenas of the city."
   Rob attempts to diminish any concerns you might reasonably have about
   Senator Obama and black liberation theology by stating that Obama has
   denounced Wright and that his close religious relationship with Wright
   might “understandably engender certain forgiveness that strangers would
   not indulge.”  Rob rationalizes such acceptance based on his
   recollection of the neighborhood priest he knew growing up who, outside
   of church, shared racist sentiments and smelled of whiskey.  Rob,
   however, did not come to this priest at twenty seven, listen to his
   sermons for twenty years, as an adult ask this man to bring him to
   Christ, preside at his wedding and baptize his daughters.  Senator
   Obama has also made it clear that he sees the black church as vital in
   furthering his hopes of developing a political action base in black
   communities.  So based on Senator Obama’s writings it is not absolutely
   clear at all that he found Christ.  What he did clearly find was
   another means to further his quest to solidify a political power base.

   There is great detail that can be found regarding other troubling Obama
   connections, including Rashid Khalidi, political fixer Antoin "Tony"
   Rezko, Nadhmi Auchi, Bernadine Dohrn, Rev. Meeks, Rev. Otis, Father
   Pfleger Louis Farrakhan, and Aiham Alsammarae.  I would be happy to
   supply or refer you to places for more detail about these relationships
   Young mom.  It appears to me that Senator Obama could make all these
   concerns about his past and personal relationships go away if he would
   answer questions and release documents.  The problem is that main
   stream media will not ask these questions, Obama will not spend time
   with anyone who will publicly put these questions to him and he is
   unwilling to release the pertinent documents.
   Rob doesn’t mention any of the latter relationships but attempts to
   dismiss the Wright-Ayers connections as an unfortunate consequence of
   choosing work in public life.  According to Rob, such nasty characters
   will happen along on an ambitious individual’s career path.  Rob
   reports that John McCain has had associations with Roger Quinn and
   William Timmons.  Lets assume what Rob says is true about these men,
   which I don’t necessarily believe is the case.  There isn’t space to
   quibble over it.  These are hired hands, not mentors that have over
   decades guided McCain’s personal, religious and professional
   development.  Much like the priest Rob discussed, this is another
   effort to dismiss disturbing insights into the Obama character using
   laughable attempts at moral equivalence.
   Running a Campaign
   Lastly Young Mom, you should be aware of the strategies being employed
   by the Obama campaign to attempt to secure this election.  A principal
   weapon in the Democratic  election effort is ACORN, the Association of
   Community Organizers for Reform Now. This group purports to be
   apolitical, committed to representing the interests of the
   underprivileged in a variety of underserved areas, mainly urban.  A
   review of ACORN’s history demonstrates that they are anything but
   that.  A complete primer on this band of thieves masquerading as
   community do-gooders can be found [33]here.  With some diligence, you
   can find multiple reports from a variety of MSM sources, implicating
   ACORN in fraudulent voting activities in the upcoming election. In
   [34]Cleveland. In [35]Detroit. In [36]New Mexico. In [37]Las Vegas. And
   in [38]Milwaukee the “community organizers” are hard at work, and it
   ain’t at removing asbestos from rundown housing or tutoring in school
   basements.  They are paying people to register to vote, sometimes with
   money, in other cases with cigarettes.  They are encouraging
   individuals to register multiple times to vote.
   There are too numerous to report past reminders of ACORN activities out
   there, but this one from 2007 in Seattle is representative of numerous
   others:
   The Seattle Times adds that the announcement of criminal charges came
   after the King County Canvassing Board revoked 1,762 allegedly
   fraudulent voter registrations submitted by ACORN employees.  According
   to prosecutors, six ACORN workers “had admitted filling out
   registration forms with names they found in phone books last October.
   The canvassers filled out the forms while sitting around a table at the
   downtown Seattle Public Library.”
   Senator Obama, is intimately linked to ACORN (has taught at ACORN
   leadership seminars, represented ACORN interests in motor voter
   registration).  From Senator Obama meeting with ACORN leaders last
   November, “I've been fighting alongside ACORN on issues you care about
   my entire career. Even before I was an elected official, when I ran
   Project Vote voter registration drives in Illinois, ACORN was smack dab
   in the middle of it, and we appreciate your work.”  ACORN is a
   supposedly non-partisan voter registration organization that has had
   many of its activists indicted and convicted of voter fraud violations.
    Senator Obama has been involved with ACORN throughout his career and
   in turn, ACORN’s political arm has endorsed him while its non-political
   arm is pledging to spend $35 million this year registering voters—
   quoting John Fund, “most will be real but many fictional.” The
   Pittsburgh Tribune-Review has details regarding the Senator’s
   willingness to provide less than transparent support for ACORN
   activities:
   U.S. Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign paid more than $800,000
   to an offshoot of the liberal Association of Community Organizations
   for Reform Now for services the Democrat’s campaign says it mistakenly
   misrepresented in federal reports.
   An Obama spokesman said Federal Election Commission reports would be
   amended to show Citizens Services Inc. — a subsidiary of ACORN — worked
   in “get-out-the-vote” projects, instead of activities such as polling,
   advance work and staging major events as stated in FEC finance reports
   filed during the primary.

   Rob mentions in his note that Senator McCain has ties to ACORN, and
   attempts to dismiss the group as a non-sequitur in campaign
   discussions.  McCain did attend an immigration rally which ACORN
   co-sponsored.  That is the extent of McCain’s association with ACORN.
   The group is perpetrating massive voter fraud across the country, is
   registering democrats mainly in cities, has had its offices raided by
   police in Las Vegas for suspicion of voter fraud, and has received
   $800,000 worth of support from the Obama campaign.
   The financing of the Obama campaign is equally troubling Young Mom.
   Senator Obama has received historical records of donations under $200.
   These donations now total greater than $220,000,000.  Donations less
   than $200 are not routinely monitored by the FEC and this might be a
   tribute to the amazing democratization of politics in the internet
   age.  These [39]Newsmax and [40]Spectator pieces report on known
   multiple illegal Obama campaign donations.
   For example, a donor identified as “Pro, Doodad,” from “Nando, NY,”
   gave $19,500 in 786 separate donations, most for $25.  For most of the
   donations, Mr. Doodad Pro listed his employer as “Loving” and his
   profession as “You.”   Mr. Doodad apparently has a “You” partner at the
   “Loving” named “Good Will”. Following FEC requests, the Obama campaign
   began refunding money to Doodad Pro in February 2008. In all, about
   $8,425 was charged back to a credit card. But that still left a net
   total of $11,165 as of Sept. 20, way over the individual limit of
   $4,600. Regarding Mr. Good Will, analysis of the 1.4 million individual
   contributions in the latest master file for the Obama campaign
   discovered 1,000 separate entries for Mr. Good Will, most of them for
   $25.  In total, Mr. Good Will gave $17,375.  Following this and
   subsequent FEC requests, campaign records show that 330 contributions
   from Mr. Good Will were credited back to a credit card. But the most
   recent report, filed on Sept. 20, showed a net cumulative balance of
   $8,950 — still well over the $4,600 limit.
   Let’s presume Mr. Doodad’s and Will’s donations originated in the US.
   How about the possibility of illegal donations to Senator Obama from
   foreign nationals? This from the “[41]The American Thinker”:
   Despite dropping the groundbreaking bombshell  story of "Palestinian"
   brothers from the Rafah refugee camp in Gaza who donated $33,000 to
   Obama's campaign, no big media picked up the story. Jihadis donating to
   Obama from Gaza? Could there be a bigger story?  Foreign donations are
   illegal, but this story was all that and so much more. The
   "Palestinian" brothers were proud and vocal of their "love" for Obama.
   Their vocal support on behalf of "Palestinians" spoke volumes to
   Obama's campaign.
   There has been no mainstream press or media interest on these
   subjects.  Honestly Young mom, would there be interest if John McCain
   got donations from Palestinian refugee camps?
   Obama returned the Palestinian dollars, but never reported it to the
   FEC; and as above, Camp Obama has been much slower to return other
   illegal donations. For the doubters, observations can be corroborated
   by going to the FEC website.  All the campaign contribution data is
   there.  You can troll through it just as the above sources have done.
   Other foreign contributors of small donations to the Obama campaign,
   with uncertain national status, come from France, Virgin Islands,
   Planegg, Vienna, Hague, Madrid, London, AE, IR, Geneva,Tokyo, Bangkok,
   Turin, Paris, Munich, Madrid, Roma, Zurich, Netherlands, Moscow,
   Ireland, Milan, Singapore, Bejing, Switzerland, Toronto, Vancouver, La
   Creche, Pak Chong, Dublin, Panama, Krabi, Berlin, Geneva, Buenos Aires,
   Prague, Nagoya, Budapest, Barcelona, Sweden, Taipei, Hong Kong, Rio de
   Janeiro, Sydney, Zurich, Ragusa, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Uganda, Mumbia,
   Nagoya, Tunis, Zacatecas, St, Croix, Mississauga, Laval, Nadi,
   Behchoko, Ragusa, DUBIA, Lima, Copenhagen, Quaama, Jeddah, Kabul,
   Cairo, Nassau and Luxembourg.
   How about those small donations democratizing the election? Unmonitored
   and in the internet age, well, maybe not the democratization we might
   have hoped for.  This might all be a moot point.  While not
   specifically commented on at this time by the Senator, would an Obama
   administration consider election reform that would include legalizing
   foreign contributions?  This would conform to his worldview.  If just
   these reported observations, very possibly the tip of the Obama
   iceberg, were attributed to John McCain, would it make it above the
   fold of the NYT…for days?  Would McCain still be in the race Young
   Mom?
   So where is the national outrage over the conduct of the Obama
   campaign?  Is the actual activity itself OK, as well as the willingness
   of main stream media to look the other way and functionally serve as a
   cog in the Obama machine?  There are clear disagreements that many of
   us have on critical political issues, but most conservatives couldn’t
   support a Republican campaign built on such tactics.  Is it reasonable
   to assume that for most, at least in this country, political views are
   derived from core values that include courage, integrity, honesty and
   commitment?  If so, why are some of us willing to tolerate, and others
   actively support, a campaign and adulating media that promote goon
   tactics as standard operating procedure in pursuit of the Presidency?
   If a fellow citizen fully accepts the Obama political solutions as
   best, fair enough, we can debate those points.  May the best plan win.
   Where, however, is the anger from both sides of the aisle over the
   deceptive, deceitful, and thuggish conduct of the Obama campaign, with
   the traditional media as unindicted co-conspirators?  I expect this
   observation will elicit protests from Liberal friends but the
   Republican playbook is simply different.   John McCain is simply an
   honorable man who refuses to debase our political system this way.  If
   he had Young mom, you would have heard about it.

[45]Benghazi: Tip of the Treason Iceberg

   [46][benghazi_lightbox.jpg] The whole Benghazi affair gets more putrid
   by the minute. We maintained a "Consulate" (or CIA base) in a hell hole
   known as Benghazi with an original security force that included an
   armed 16 man security team. The "Consulate" was attacked several times
   over the last six months, most notoriously in June when a hole was
   blown in the wall of the "Consulate" by an IED. During this same time
   period in Benghazi the Red Cross office was attacked with an RPG round,
   a UN convoy was targeted with an IED, and an RPG attack was launched on
   a British convoy escorting the British Ambassador. The  Brits closed
   their consulate and the Red Cross shuttered its doors. .
   What was the US response to the violence in Benghazi? No one talked
   about it, apparently the President never knew, and we reduced the
   security force protecting our Consulate...despite the objections of the
   leader of the security team and Ambassador Chris Stevens. Sure, this
   all makes sense. Got it.
   [47][th?id=I.4511133813833866&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=228&amp;h=149&amp;c=7&a
   mp;rs=1]
   Fast forward to Sept, 11th when on a quiet night, the Ambassador
   entertains a Turkish emissary, and sees him off at the gate of the
   American Consulate...40 minutes before a multi-pronged attack is
   launched. All appears quiet. There are no crowds. There are no
   protests. Forty minutes later the silence is broken by gunfire and
   explosions. A coordinated assault unfolds which will include staged
   assaults with RPGs and mortar rounds. The State Department is
   immediately aware an attack is underway via emergency alerts sent to
   Tripoli and the State Department Command Center in DC.
   This attack raged for nearly seven hours after the State Department was
   notified it was underway. Several pleas for help and assistance were
   made. Our only response was to send a State Department security team
   from Tripoli that arrived 5 hours into the fight, after being delayed
   by Libyan officials at the Benghazi airport! It remains absolutely
   unclear why in extremis teams from EUROCOM, assets that might have been
   floating in the Med, a nearby FAST team or armed drones were not
   employed to assist in defending Americans and American territory now
   under attack.
   This attack was watched shortly after its inception in real time via a
   drone ordered overhead. Despite what is clearly a planned assault, and
   months of warning that the situation in Benghazi was unstable, the
   official explanation offered by the WH and its minions, for almost two
   weeks, is the lie that a video was responsible for Muslim outrage that
   triggered spontaneous outbursts of violence. The President, two weeks
   after the attacks, at the UN declared:
   [48][th?id=I.5059875975397559&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=193&amp;h=150&amp;c=7&a
   mp;rs=1] "In every country, there are those who find different
   religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom
   for themselves must ask how much they are willing to tolerate freedom
   for others. That is what we saw play out the last two weeks, as a crude
   and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world."
   The Secretary of State[49] told the father of slain ex-SEAL Ty Woods,
   who (with Glenn Doherty, also an ex-Navy SEAL) died attempting to
   defend the US Consulate, painting AQ mortar men with a laser hoping for
   supporting fire, "We will make sure that the person who made that film
   is arrested and prosecuted.” Susan Rice, the UN Secretary, went on five
   Sunday shows the weekend following the attack and repeated the same
   story blaming an unknown  video with 300 views as responsible for
   righteous Muslim outrage that led to a spontaneous attack on the
   Benghazi consulate.
   Last week Gen. Petraeus, then CIA Director, testified that in his
   estimation he knew within 24 hours that the Benghazi events were a
   planned, terrorist assault. He reported that references to Al Qaeda
   organizations and terrorist coordination of these attacks was removed
   from "CIA talking points." Talking points! How about we all just decide
   to tell the truth and forget about talking points. We had been
   attacked, a consulate (US soil) in flames, destroyed, and four men
   dead, including our Ambassador. And what do these families, and the
   American people have for consolation? We all get a lying President, a
   lying Sec of State, a lying UN Ambassador, and a lying Sec Def.

   [50]http://media.townhall.com/Townhall/Car/a/GM120411CLR-PanettaC201204
   11045145.jpg And when the lie becomes increasingly unsupportable, we
   are treated to a Sec Def who educates us on the role of the military,
   “The basic principle is that you don’t deploy forces into harm’s way
   without knowing what’s going on, without having some real-time
   information about what’s taking place.” Excuse me Mr. Sec Def,  this is
   exactly the mission of the special ops community…you know, the warriors
   you bloviating, mendacious cowards in this administration always tell
   us you are committed to supporting! This lying sack of crap should be
   tarred, feathered and thrown into the Potomac.  The [51]depth of
   deception and treason involved in Benghazi is staggering. This
   astonishing duplicity prompts multiple questions.
   Why did our consulate remain open in Benghazi remain open given the
   security situation? Why did we reduce security in this unstable
   environment? Were we reclaiming weapons loosed by the Libyan
   "liberation" and sending them to Syrian rebels? Were we partnered with
   Al Qaeda elements in Libya to secure and run these weapons? Were we
   working with the Turks and Saudis on this project? Were we shipping
   these arms to Syrian "rebels" who are Al Qaeda in Syria? Was Ambassador
   Stevens the front man for a gun running operation? Was this the Mideast
   version of Fast and Furious...on steroids?
   [52][th?id=I.4629563233601652&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=177&amp;h=150&amp;c=7&a
   mp;rs=1] Regarding the attack, when did the President find out about
   this situation? Was it one hour after it began during his meetings
   scheduled with Sec Def Panetta and Gen. Dempsey? Despite multiple calls
   for help why were military asset options in the region not mobilized?
   Were theater commanders told to stand down in mobilizing these assets?
   Why have we not heard from key theater commanders who have either
   mysteriously retired or been removed from command since September 11th?
   What does Gen. Ham AFRICOM Commander have to say? Why was RADM
   Gauoette, Commander of the John Stennis Strike Group, on station in the
   Med on Sept 11th, relieved? What does he have to say? Were these men
   willing to stand up and send support to Benghazi in spite of orders
   from DC to stand down?
   The last set of questions around Benghazi should focus on the fact that
   despite a horrific attack of a US "consulate", the "consulate" was
   never secured. CNN reporters, walking through the rubble three days
   after the event, found Ambassador Steven's diary! We were told
   endlessly by the President that after the attack he ordered forces to
   the scene to secure the consulate and personnel in Benghazi. I guess
   secure is a pretty relative term. We were also told that the FBI was
   being ordered to the scene of the violence. The FBI did not arrive in
   Benghazi until three weeks after the attack. Despite that copyboy for
   the Obama administration, [53]Jay Carney was informing us that an
   active investigation was ongoing 10 days after the attack.
   Investigators were not on the ground in Benghazi until October!
   So an American Ambassador is murdered, three other Americans killed and
   a "consulate" sacked, but US investigators don't show up for three
   weeks? Why is this? This is inexplicable.
   Now enter Paula Broadwell and perhaps more interestingly, Jill Kelly.
   Broadwell apparently was Petraeus' paramour. Though we are told that
   the FBI learned of this relationship only later this summer, and the
   President only heard about it election eve, it is likely the General
   was involved with Ms. Broadwell when she began writing his biography in
   Afghanistan. Many know they had a relationship and it is likely so did
   the FBI and the WH. Why nominate such a man for CIA Director then? That
   is unclear, but Jill Kelly, a socialite who volunteered to lead social
   functions at home of CENTCOM, MacDill AFB in Tampa, began receiving
   threatening emails from Ms. Broadwell cautioning her to stay away from
   her guy, Gen. Petraeus.
   Ms. Kelly is presented to us a socialite gadfly who served as a
   volunteer hostess for leadership at MacDill AFB, home of CENTCOM. Ms.
   Kelly resides with her husband in a posh Tampa bayside residence which
   hosted numerous affairs introducing influential members of Tampa
   society to the military leadership at MacDill. [54]Ms. Kelly, however,
   appears to be [55]more than just a Tampa socialite. Ms. Kelly was known
   to the WH, visiting the White House three times. Her social expertise
   in Tampa was in setting up events for Muslim interest groups seeking to
   gain influence at MacDill. Jill (formerly Khawam) Kelly is a Christian
   Arab of Lebanese descent, who was well known in the Muslim Arab
   embassies of Washington for doing their bidding and hosting their
   parties at and near MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. From the Wall
   Street Journal:
   "Middle Eastern diplomats in Washington also knew Ms. Kelley, who came
   from a Lebanese immigrant family and who helped arrange social
   activities when dignitaries from the region visited Tampa, diplomats
   said. She also sometimes attended parties at Washington embassies."
   This might just be one more example of Islamic influence peddling,
   except it involves our military. While the American public might
   believe we are engaged in a war with Islamists, who represent the views
   of vast majority of Muslims in the Middle East, it appears some in our
   military leadership are more than willing to socialize with the enemy
   here in the US. This is old news for the Obama administration.
   [56][valerie-jarrett-puppet-master.jpg] The President’s most trusted
   adviser is [57]Valerie Jarrett. Ms. Jarrett has no Congressional
   appointment yet sits at the right hand of the president with a taxpayer
   funded Secret Service detail and the title of Senior Adviser. Ms.
   Jarrett is well known on the Chicago political and social scene, but
   little discussed is the fact that she is Iranian born, to American
   parents. Less discussed is that her father in law was a Communist,
   [58]Vernon Jarrett, who worked closely with the Communist mentor of
   President Obama, [59]Frank Marshall Davis. Ms. Jarrett believes that
   the President has a mandate to radically transform US political
   institutions. While an amateur politician, she wields incredible power
   in the Obama White House. She was the force that led to the departure
   of two Obama Chiefs of Staff: Rahm Emmanuel and Bill Daley. In the
   weeks following Benghazi, [60]Jarrett was sent to Qatar to negotiate
   with the Iranians regarding their nuclear program.  It is as unclear
   what Ms. Jarrett negotiated with the Iranians as it is why anyone would
   send this woman to conduct such negotiations.
   [61][th?id=I.4606812770535717&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=224&amp;h=154&amp;c=7&a
   mp;rs=1] The Department of State is also heavily infiltrated with
   Muslim influence, and not just at the Middle East desk. Secretary of
   State Clinton's most senior and trusted advisers is [62]Huma Abedin.
   Abedin, Secretary Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff, is the wife of
   disgraced NY Congressman Anthony Wiener, She has extensive and
   irrefutable familial ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and an al-Qaeda
   financier named Abdullah Omar Naseef.
   Prior US Presidents, including [63]GW Bush, blazed the trail to the
   White House for Muslim influence. President Obama, however, has made
   "outreach" to the Muslim world a clear priority for his administration.
   Could we have envisioned the day where the NASA Director would be told
   a [64]key mission for NASA was, “Find a way to reach out to the Muslim
   world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them
   feel good about their historic contribution to science, math, and
   engineering”? Does outreach mean we are actually partnered with nations
   and terrorist groups determined to destroy us? Learning the truth about
   Benghazi may answer this question. Does outreach mean partnering with
   Islamic elements at the highest levels of our government? Apparently
   so.
   [65][th?id=I.4959871959892287&amp;pid=1.7] Based on the fraud and
   dishonesty of multiple senior officials in the Obama administration
   regarding Benghazi alone, resignations, raincoats and handcuffs, and
   criminal charges would be in order. Benghazi, however, is only the tip
   of a treacherous iceberg that seeks to sink the American ship of state.
   The barbarians are inside the gate and treason doesn’t begin to
   describe the reprehensible sedition and treachery of the Obama
   administration which allowed this to happen.
