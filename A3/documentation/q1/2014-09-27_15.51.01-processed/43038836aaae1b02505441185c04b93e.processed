   this is old but please describe fatin thank u muah :*
   fatin is gorgeous inside and out. for every living soul, they should
   know that she is someone that will be there for you no matter what. for
   how long you have not been talking to her, she will always cheer for
   you silently. as a fan, i have never seen a sane exo fan until i met
   her. she speak the truth and the reality and never in denial. at such
   young age, i am envious of her courageous character as a person.

   Oh thank goodness, even though my life was 817293819x better without
   looking at his twitter, I'm glad you shared that cause I was able to
   report his ass
   I am glad you reported him. I was so angry but I kept cool .

   Wait did you retweet kysadrian because you agree with him or to share
   to your followers an example of a douchebag? :o
   The second one because rude people cannot be tolerated.

   So if he's just being rebellious or trying to be badass during that
   stage of puberty, I don't think it's fair to label someone as iljin
   just because of that. Since iljin is a serious term in Korea..
   It is normal for human to react to rumors. Even if some are just over
   reacting. But I am sure with this, Taehyun will become stronger.

   You like exo???
   YES I FUCKING LOVE EXO
   [24]27 days ago
   So he was really an iljin then? Taehyun I mean.
   I don't know how concrete the evidences of him being an iljin. It is
   just my thoughts of what I read in those articles. I just hope he is
   not but if he does, that is what I think.

   what do you think of taehyun's scandal of him bullying?
   I don't really say my thoughts about this matter but since you asked.
   Honestly, I detest rude people and bullying is something I cannot
   accept. I find bullying is something like a joke not on their victim
   but as a person who conducted it. I can never ever forget taehyun's
   past and I might sound like a bad fan but there sometimes you just
   can't forget. However, people forgot about those kids who came from a
   broken family. They struggled from depression. These people are
   emotionally unstable. His actions are unforgiven definitely. But living
   in a place where you called home can no longer have peace, do you think
   they can keep up with their life? And the fact what he was facing this
   matter at a very young age. Taehyun is an idol that teaches you to
   survive life even if it's hard and I am sure he is doing all of this
   with the thought if his mother.

   How real is namsong?
   I ship namsong so hard but I am not the kind to think that they are gay
   bc both of them are definitely straight. I love their friendship and
   every interaction of theirs. The way they talk about each other tells a
   lot how close they are right now. From the two that fought in WIN to
   the ones that couldn't live with each other and having the needs to
   irritate the hell out of each other. Taehyun and Mino's friendship
   developed from strangers to something that is more than friends. And I
   am sure in the future, there are more to come. Not just that, their
   personalities are opposite. You know how they say friends are always
   different from who you are. Taehyun the one that always careful with
   words, the one that think before he acts on something and he is the one
   that is very cautious with everything. But Mino patches the missing
   part of him where he teaches Taehyun how to be free, letting lose with
   himself and find happiness in every way. Mino taught him that it is ok
   to be not perfect in everything and it is ok to make mistake. They
   blend with each other not just their music but also personalities and
   characters. This is the reason why I love namsong. Not just a smut otp.
