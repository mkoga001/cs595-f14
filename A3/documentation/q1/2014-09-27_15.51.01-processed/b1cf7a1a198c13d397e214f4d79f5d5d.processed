What people think of Center Mass Group

     “Having attended multiple hands-on instructional courses in firearms
     training, I was impressed with how Chris broke down the fundamentals
     in a way I’d not seen before. This explanation has really helped me
     grasp a lot of the “why” in recognizing my bad habits and working to
     correct them.”

   Bryan Black Editor-in-Chief, Founder of ITS Tactical
   [23]http://itstactical.com

     “This book is the Real Deal from a great guy. Want to learn? Learn
     from the best, that teaches the best!”

   Scott McEwen Best Selling Author, American Sniper and Sniper Elite

     “To those who encounter Chris personally, you can expect an icy
     stare and avery sharp correction when your shooting performance is
     not up to his highstandards. You can then expect his strong hand on
     your shoulder for reassurance and encouragement to relax and try
     again. Chris has always received the highest marks from me and his
     fellow SEALs. Today he continues that mentorship into his retirement
     and shares those important traits with the next generation of young
     SEALs and men and women who look to him for “Proper Technique” with
     whatever he teaches.”

   Don Shipley SEAL Team ONE, SEAL Team TWO. Owner Extreme SEAL Experience

     Chris Sajnog has managed to condense in one book the essence of gun
     fighting. Anyone being a Military, Law Enforcement or Citizen of the
     Free World should not only buy this book but often come back to the
     fundamentals described in it. In these uncertain times, such a
     concentration of wisdom and knowledge is a must have.
