   ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT.
   “Joseph bolted out of the kitchen into the back yard, and Adam started
   screaming. It curdled my blood. I thought I was going to die of a heart
   attack. I whipped around to see what was behind me – to see what had
   frightened the boys. There was nothing there, but I was too afraid to
   go down the hallway and look for… Whoever or whatever.”

   ============================

   [I'm an Army brat. All of this happened in Texas, just outside of Fort
   Hood. The names of the boys have been changed for obvious reasons.]

   My first job was babysitting. I was so proud when my parents finally
   decided I was old enough and responsible enough, and thrilled that I’d
   be able to supplement my modest allowance with money I had earned
   myself. I felt all grown up at twelve. I was officially a “Big Girl.”

   The first family I worked for had a newborn baby girl. Before she was
   born, her military father had been gravely injured in a helicopter
   accident (his craft had become tangled in some illegally strung
   electrical wires), and I took care of her as her mom stayed by
   his side, waiting for him to regain consciousness, and eventually
   recover. This babysitting job lasted for months and months.

   When I was thirteen, my second babysitting job was for a military
   family with two sons – Adam, four and Joseph, three – every weekday
   after school. I was a few days into my new job when it happened.

   I was doing my homework at the dinner table as the boys played with
   their Matchbox cars a few feet away in the kitchen, where the floor was
   smooth for racing. They were having fun, until things took a turn for
   the angry. Joseph was upset because his older brother had grabbed one
   of his cars, and demanded it back. I stopped doing my homework to watch
   what happened next.

   To understand how I reacted (or didn’t, as the case may be), you should
   know I have just one sister, and we are less than a year apart in age.
   My parents generally let us work out our differences ourselves. If and
   when we couldn’t or wouldn’t, then (and only then) they would step in
   and resolve it for us.

   It became apparent that Adam wasn’t going to give Joseph back his car,
   and that Joseph was getting more and more upset about this outrage. I
   stood up from the table, faced the boys, and firmly said, “Adam, come
   here!”

   What happened next is burned into my memory in detail. It is among the
   most terrifying things that have ever happened to me. All of a sudden,
   Joseph bolted out of the kitchen into the back yard, and Adam started
   screaming. It curdled my blood. I thought I was going to die of a heart
   attack. I whipped around to see what was behind me – to see what had
   frightened the boys. There was nothing there, but I was too afraid to
   go down the hallway and look for… Whoever or whatever.

   I started quickly toward Adam to ask him what was happening, and his
   screaming got worse – so much worse, though I would not have thought
   that possible. It dawned on me that I was scaring him more. I squatted
   down to his level, and tried to get him to tell me what was happening.
   All he would say between screams was, “Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t.” He
   was bawling. To say he was trembling doesn’t do it justice. It was more
   like a seizure.

   I started begging him to calm down, to please tell me what was wrong,
   that I was scared, too, and I needed his help… That I didn’t know where
   his brother had gone… That he had to trust me so I could protect all of
   us from… Whoever or whatever.

   It was then that he told me he was afraid of ME. He thought I was going
   to hurt him.

   [Dear reader, you don’t know me, but I don’t do that. It’s just not who
   I am. It is not who I have ever been.]

   It took time to get it out of him, but Adam explained, in a child’s
   way, that he thought I was going to make him go find a “switch” in the
   backyard, bring it to me, pull down his pants, bend over and grab his
   feet, and “get whipped.” If he returned with a switch that wasn’t bad
   enough, I would go and find a really terrible one to use. If he tried
   to resist, I would hurt him worse. These were the rules, as explained
   to him by his daddy. “Oh, god,” I thought, “He’s four, and he knows
   these sick rules?”

   I started crying, too. I put my arms around his wracked body, and
   promised him that I would never hit him or hurt him. I told him he was
   not bad, that my sister and I sometimes argued over toys and other
   things, and that we were good. It took time, but he calmed down, and so
   did I. I asked him to help me find his brother.

   We went into the backyard. Joseph was nowhere to be seen. It was a
   fenced-in yard, with a gate latch too high for Joseph to reach. I hoped
   he wasn’t strong enough to climb over the fence. Adam and I looked
   everywhere – up the trees, under the bushes, in the doghouse, under the
   porch… We finally found him. Two metal garbage cans were chained to the
   fence. Somehow, Joseph had managed to wedge himself between and behind
   the cans, against the fence. I could see he was crying and shaking, and
   that my having found him was making it worse.

   It took a while, but with Adam’s help, I convinced Joseph that it was
   safe to come out on his own, that nothing bad was going to happen to
   his brother or to him, that my promise was a promise he could trust me
   to keep forever.

   I got the boys inside, and started to deal with how they looked. Adam’s
   face was blotchy, red and swollen, and he still had the shakes. I gave
   him an icy-wet towel to hold on his face. Joseph’s back and the backs
   of his arms were crisscrossed with the pattern of the chain-link fence,
   and his clothes were dirty. I brushed off his clothes, and used a soapy
   rag to clean them off. I could do nothing to fix the pattern in his
   skin, but I was sure it would clear up before his parents got home that
   evening.

   Later, as the boys ate dinner, I made my decision. I was not going to
   tell anyone what happened – not their parents, and not mine. I had my
   reasons. One was selfish (I was afraid of losing the job and the
   money), but the rest were not. I was afraid something bad would happen
   to the boys if their parents found out that they told. I was afraid
   that if I was not their babysitter anymore, they might get one who hit
   them. I thought that if, every single day, I told their parents what
   wonderful, good boys they had been, life might get better for them.

   ============================

   I have no respect for heritage. “The way things are,” “The way things
   have always been,” “The way we do things around here,” “The way we have
   always done things?” I am not impressed. I know what I know, and I know
   right from wrong. If this happened to you as a child, and you “turned
   out fine,” I am truly relieved and sincerely happy for you, but here’s
   the thing:

   You can’t go back and re-run your childhood, changing that one
   variable, and measure the results. Even if you could, I don’t give a
   damn what those results would be. I believe that from the moment you’re
   born, until the moment you die, you are a human being with human
   rights. You belong to yourself. There should be limits on what anyone
   may do to you. One of those limits is hit you.

   “Spank.” “Punch.” “Whip.” “Assault.” “Slap.” “Beat.” “Whoop.” “Strike.”
   “Smack.” “Slam.”

   I don’t care what they call it.
   I don’t care why they do it.
   I don’t care what your relationship is to them.
   I don’t care how little you are when they do it to you.

   It’s wrong. It’s evil. If it isn’t a crime, it should be.

[38]FUCK THE POLICE: My Personal Story

   [39]August 14, 2014[40]Uncategorized[41]theologop

   When I was away at college, I was injured. Long story. But the short of
   it is that my calf was severed laterally, through the tendon to the
   bone. I was not expected to walk again (but I eventually did.) Once I
   recovered enough from blood loss to be up and on crutches, I went
   shopping one night — just a few groceries, since I had to hang a bag
   around my neck to carry anything. I got home, and went up the stairs to
   my apartment.

   [SIDEBAR: Going up stairs on crutches is a snap. Going down is the
   challenge.]

   I put away the groceries, and made queso in the microwave. I put the
   chips and queso in my neck-bag, and went to my room to watch TV and eat
   on my bed.

   I heard a knock on the door. This was around the time that my roommates
   got home from work, so I assumed one of them had forgotten their keys.
   I grabbed my crutches, and made good time to the door. I opened it, and
   on the other side was a man. The look in his eyes instantly terrified
   me. I tried to shut the door quickly, but on my crutches, I had no
   leverage. He forced his way in, and grabbed me around my neck from
   behind. He levered me so that my feet did not touch the floor, and
   moved right toward my bedroom.

   I believe to this day that he saw me get home, saw my vulnerable state,
   and waited for my bedroom light to come on to make his move.

   As he turned the corner into the hall towards my bedroom, I grabbed the
   door frame’s molding. It was a stupid idea. He kept on going, and I
   tore off all of my fingernails. He went through my bedroom door, and
   threw us both down on the bed. When he did, the very hot queso flew up
   onto both of us. Understand: Below the point where my leg was severed,
   I had no feeling. The nerves were all cut. Plus, I was scared to death.
   I knew my skin was being burned, but I didn’t feel it.

   He, on the other hand, was NOT terrified, and did. He back handed me
   across the face, said something profane, and ran away.

   I didn’t have my crutches, so I dragged myself on my stomach (way
   faster than a three-legged crawl) to the front door and locked it. I
   got up on my crutches that were lying there. I went to my room. I moved
   the food. I stripped the bed. I started laundry. I ran a bath. I got in
   the bath (except for my leg.)

   Not long after, I was sitting in the tub crying quietly when my first
   roommate got home. I don’t know what she saw, but she KNEW. She started
   banging on the door, screaming for me to let her in. I wouldn’t. She
   grabbed a coat hanger and jimmied the lock. She got in. She got it out
   of me. She said she was calling the police. I said not to. She did.

   Three officers responded — two men, and a woman. My roommate knew how I
   was raised. She knew if the cops came, I would be too polite to refuse
   to answer their questions. I told them everything.

   One of the male officers (top dog, a Detective) who was taking notes
   ended our conversation by explaining to me that:

   1) There is no such thing as “attempted rape.”

   2) I let him in. Not really “breaking and entering.”

   3) One backhand across the face is not the kind of thing that merits an
   assault charge.

   4) If they did catch him, they’d never be able to make anything
   “stick.”

   … and on and on. Lots of word salad with one point: Don’t file an
   official report. It’s not worth the trouble. Nothing will come of it.

   “Okay, Hon?”

   As sorry as I felt for myself in that moment (and it was plenty sorry),
   I felt worse for the female officer sitting next to him. The look on
   her face… I’m not a mind reader, but she looked like she was in
   physical pain. She actually openly grimaced a few times. She looked
   straight into my eyes a few times, too, as if she was screaming at me,
   “I’M SORRY! I CAN’T DO ANYTHING! PLEASE DON’T HATE ME!”

   I didn’t hate her then. I don’t hate her now. He was a Detective. She
   wasn’t. It wasn’t her show.

   The one time in my life that I really needed to be protected and
   served, I feel that I got screwed.

   You know what’s been going on lately.

   Yesterday, I said it for the first time in my life, and I meant it.

   FUCK THE POLICE.

[43]Thoughts on Killing, and on Death: A Plea

   [44]August 10, 2014[45]Uncategorized[46]theologop

   I would like to try, if I can, to change your frame on death. There is
   a very high probability that you believe in the supernatural – a
   Supreme Being and an afterlife.

   I would never ask you to stop believing, but I would like you to
   consider the implications of killing if neither a Supreme Being nor an
   afterlife exists.

   What if taking a human life ends a person forever? What if you are not
   simply stopping the body, but also erasing forever everything that
   person ever was, or ever could be? What if everything they had ever
   been, done, felt, learned, planned and hoped for stopped when their
   body stopped?

   What if there was no soul to survive?

   Everyone makes mistakes, and accidents do happen… But what if there is
   no cosmic justice? What if there is no god to mete out that justice or
   to correct human error? What if death is an end, and not a transition?

   For those of us who do not believe in the supernatural, killing and
   death are serious. They are final.

   For those who do believe, I beg you to consider the implications if you
   are mistaken.

   Thank you for reading this.

[48]Riffs from My Father – A Daughter’s Tribute

   [49]August 10, 2014[50]Uncategorized[51]theologop

   I’m an Army brat, born overseas to military parents. The circumstances
   of my birth are not at all rare, but in 2001, after the World Trade
   Centers were attacked, my identity as an American suddenly became
   suspect. The birth papers that had always been sufficient before were
   no longer good enough. My unnecessary naturalization (insisted upon by
   my mother, and a source of great mirth to the judge who administered a
   very young me The Oath of Allegiance) was no longer good enough. For a
   tidy fee, I had to petition Condoleeza Rice’s State Department to
   re-certify my American-ness (if I wanted to drive, or to fly, or to
   bank, or… you know, stuff.)

   My personal experiences make me bristle at two political conversations
   we are having: Voter ID (for obvious reasons)… and absentee fathers.

   My father served in Korea before I was born, and Vietnam after, but
   even when he wasn’t away at war, he was often away at schools, on duty
   or on maneuvers. Other Army brats will understand exactly what I’m
   talking about.

   When I was very little, and my dad was at war in Vietnam, my mom cast a
   magic spell to save him, and to protect our family from losing him. (As
   a child brought up in The Walt Disney Culture, that is how I perceived
   what she was doing.) She practiced The Sorcery of Silence with absolute
   discipline. No news reports, no TV shows, no radio broadcasts about the
   war were permitted to touch us. No conversations – casual or serious.
   An acquaintance could not ask her politely how my dad was doing in
   Vietnam. Her closest and best friends could not ask her. Other military
   wives could not ask her. She would shut them down before the question
   was even fully expressed. My mother patrolled the boundaries of her
   magic spell with fierce, zealous, unwavering vigilance.

   It worked.

   He made it.

   My first memory of my father was his return from Vietnam in 1970. I
   knew his voice from speaking to him long distance around the holidays,
   but not the face he came home with, or the body. When he landed at the
   tiny Airport in Killeen, Texas, I didn’t recognize him. I was afraid of
   him. My mother had shown my sister and I pictures of him, but he didn’t
   look like the pictures. He was painfully thin, very tan, and his hair
   was different. To me, he looked just like Elvis Presley in the movies
   broadcast by the indie TV station out of Fort Worth that my mom finally
   relented, and let my sister and I watch (but just cartoons, re-runs and
   movies… no scary news).

   So… Here was my dad, finally. Only my dad was Elvis in Love Me Tender.
   It was disorienting.

   My dad was born at the front edge of the Baby Boom in 1941, and picked
   up the guitar for real in 1959, when he entered the Army. By 1960, he
   was in Korea. By 1962, he was already Second Chair Guitar in the ship’s
   orchestra on his return. Understand: I knew none of my father’s
   biography until I was an adult, and screwed up the courage to ask him.
   (My mother’s spell had rubbed off on me.)

   After Vietnam, my dad became my dad in my actual home, a little trailer
   in Harker Heights, Texas. Having him with us was brand new to me. I was
   very little, so my memories are scant. What I do remember most is his
   guitar. My dad would play “Something,” and sing it to my mom. He would
   play “Looking Out My Backdoor” as a lullaby to my sister and me at
   bedtime. This was way before I was allowed to have a radio of my own,
   so I just assumed that my dad wrote both songs… and many of the other
   songs he would play. (FYI: My mom and dad were in love and in lust with
   each other. Even as a little child, I picked up on that. “Something”
   coming from my dad sounded completely genuine.)

   So, my dad was home. A few years later, my family moved into a real
   house, and we seemed more like the families I saw on TV. No sooner had
   we done that, than he was stationed in Germany. My parents decided that
   he would go alone, and my sister and I would start school in The
   States. After two years in Germany, he was back for the Bicentennial.

   Having a dad in the service, dipping into and out of your life, makes
   for some interesting discoveries. Thus it happened that in 1976, I
   learned something new and amazing about my very own dad.

   I was old enough now that my mom allowed me an alarm clock radio of my
   very own in my bedroom, and it even had a built-in cassette recorder. I
   listened to KIXS 93.3 FM religiously. They counted down the local top
   hits every night. They broadcast from local live music dives. They had
   a late-night DJ right out of Almost Famous. They also made a very big
   deal out of debuting new songs. When they debuted [52]More Than a
   Feeling by Boston, I was taping.

   Wow… WOW! GREAT SONG!!!

   I couldn’t wait to play it for my dad when he got home. (He and I could
   often be found combing the racks at pawn shops for great music, and his
   collection of LP’s numbered in the thousands.)

   When I heard his car pull into our driveway, I was ready for action. He
   barely made it through the door and put down his stuff before I pulled
   him into The Music Room (babbling like a maniac the whole time I’m
   sure). I popped the cassette I’d recorded in, and pressed play. He
   loved me, so of course he patiently listened. He reached for his guitar
   and noodled along distractedly as the song played. I thought to myself,
   “He doesn’t like it like I like it.”

   I was a little crushed. Okay, a lot crushed.

   At the end of the song, he plugged his guitar into his amp, looked up
   at me, and said, “Play it again.” I rewound the cassette, and pressed
   play.

   My dad, without missing a lick, played back the entire song flawlessly,
   his ’63 Sunburst Strat BLAZING AT FULL VOLUME! Every hair on my
   pre-pubescent body stood straight up. It was a moment. It was THE
   moment that I found out my dad was a Guitar God.

   Holy crap. How did I not know that?

   The next year, he was sent away again, this time to Indiana for
   “school.” That summer, my mom packed me and my sister into the car, and
   made the long drive to be with him. That was the summer that I learned
   what it was like to live in a hotel, swim anytime I wanted, eat every
   meal at the same diner, and see a By-God-Hollywood-Summer-Blockbuster
   on a for-real massive big city movie screen. It was 1977, and the movie
   was Star Wars.

   By this time, I was at that age where girls start thinking about boys.
   Not in a sexual way, in a Marcia-Brady-meets-Davy-Jones kind of way. I
   knew my parents were nuts about each other, and I was curious about
   that. So, when we got back to Texas from Indiana, I started snooping.
   In their closet, I found a beautiful, diaphanous, orange negligee set.
   In their nightstand, I found The Joy of Sex. In their dresser I found
   girly magazines…

   … And under the girly magazines, hinged boxes, like the ones you get
   when you buy real jewelry. One was normal-sized. The others were much
   bigger. The small one contained a set of cufflinks, but not like any
   I’d ever seen. They looked military, and they looked old to me. Inside
   the larger boxes were medals. I didn’t know exactly what they meant,
   but I knew they were about war. My mom’s spell grabbed me by the
   throat. I put the boxes back. I put the girly magazines back on top of
   them. I got the hell out of there.

   What I want to tell you about my dad:

   He was gone a lot. There were years when he probably saw a lot less of
   us than a divorced dad living in the same city would. When politicians
   talk about “two-parent families” and “absentee fathers,” I hate it.
   When I was growing up, the most important thing to me was knowing that
   my parents were in love with each other, and that they loved me. Sure,
   I wished my dad was around more, but I had a good childhood.

   My dad was a soldier, but he never brought his work – or his weapon –
   home.

   My dad had one Army buddy that was invited to our home for football and
   food, and only one, Cosby. My parents were so perfect on the issue of
   race that I didn’t know there was such a thing until I started school.

   How this all started:

   This afternoon, someone tweeted me [53]More Than A Feeling. “I closed
   my eyes and I slipped away,” right back to 1976.

   Tonight, I called my dad. I asked him if I could ask him a question. He
   said, “yes.” I told him he could tell me no. He said, “okay.” I told
   him he could not answer me if he didn’t want to. He said, “okay.” I
   told him it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if he didn’t want to talk about
   it.

   He told me to ask him.

   I told him what I’ve told you about the girly magazines and the boxes.

   The cufflinks were awarded to my father in the early 60’s when his
   band, The Stardusters, won the talent contest in Korea.

   The medals were The Good Conduct Medal, The Campaign Medal, The Cross
   of Galantry, and The Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster. All of these
   medals were awarded to my father for his service to his country in
   Vietnam.

   My father.

   Guitar Hero.

   War Hero.

   My Hero.

[61]Confessions of a Liberal

   [62]July 21, 2014[63]Uncategorized[64]theologop

   I’m ready to come a little further out of the closet, and admit to
   being a deviant.  Hi, I’m TheoloGOP… and I’m a liberal.

   I don’t like to shop. I hate shopping. Look, I’ll scoop a dirty cat
   box, detail the car, even watch “Meet The Press” quicker than I’ll go
   to the store without a fight.  Don’t get me wrong.  I have shopped.
   I’ll even do it on my own sometimes, around the holidays, but I don’t
   like it.  And what’s worse, I don’t understand the thrill others find
   in it.

   I don’t want a Lexus, BMW, or Mercedes.  I drive a clunker.  I like my
   clunker.  If I had a gazillion dollars, I’d still like my clunker.
   Wanna know what I think when I see a car that costs over $30,000?  I
   think, “Oh my god! That car costs over $30,000!!!”  I don’t think,
   “Gee, I’d sure like to have one of those!”  I think, “Man, I’m sure
   glad I don’t want one of those!”

   I think boxing is nuts.  I don’t get it.  I can’t figure out how it can
   be legal, actually.  Basically, as I understand it, it’s illegal to
   beat someone up unless you are acting in self-defense.  It’s also
   illegal to beat someone up for money.  And yet… we have boxing.
   Whenever I surf past a boxing match (for instance on HBO) it makes me
   queasy.  I feel sorry for the guys in the ring.  I can’t understand how
   a tape of two guys beating each other up for real isn’t obscene, but a
   tape of two people pretending to get jiggy is.

   I have the Circadian rhythms of a raccoon.  I prefer to stay up all
   night and sleep during the day.  According to my mother, I have always
   been this way.  As she tells it, when I was a baby, I would play
   quietly with my toys in my crib at night, and go to sleep around
   sun-up.  As for me, I don’t remember ever being any other way.  I get
   my second wind at about 8 or 9 at night.  That’s when I feel the best,
   and I’m raring to go.  Noon to me probably feels the same way 3 a.m.
   feels to most other folks.  I’m nocturnal.  An owl.

   I have a Samson complex, and not just about me.  I like long hair.  I
   like it on everyone, male or female.  To my eye, short hair looks funny
   — unnatural.  I hate getting my hair cut.  I don’t like anyone near my
   head with a pair of scissors.  When I do get my hair cut (or more
   often, cut my own hair), I feel weird for days.  I sort of have to work
   up to it, to cut it.

   I don’t like any sports except for Baseball, and just The Red Sox.  I
   watched a ton of football with my dad growing up, and I loved spending
   that time doing that with him, but as soon as I left home for college,
   I stopped cold.  I went to Texas A&M, where football is a religion, but
   I only went to one game in four years, and only under duress.  I have
   also never understood, AT ALL, why sports coverage is part of every
   regular local newscast.  Personally, I’d like to see the
   “News-Weather-Sports” lineup become the “News-Weather-Furry Mammals”
   line-up.  I’d like to see all the sports reporters be replaced with
   Jack Hanna clones.  Come to think of it, you could throw out the
   weather part, too, and I wouldn’t mind in the least.  That’s what the
   internet’s for.

   Now, here comes the serious part…

   I don’t want to have children.  I don’t want to start a biological
   family.  I love other people’s kids, and I’m great with them (I have
   family and a long list of former neighbors who can back me up on this
   one), but I know I am happier without children of my own.  I’m also
   sure that the kind of life I now have would be gone for good if kids
   came into the picture.  That’s the way it is.  And honestly, that’s the
   way I WANT it to be.  I will admit to the occasional pang of baby-lust,
   but I’ve never had a case of baby-love.

   God has never spoken to me.  Not once.  I grew up in a religious home.
    I went to church, to Sunday School, to Vacation Bible School, to CYF
   summer sleep-away camp near Athens, Texas.  I prayed A LOT.  But I
   still vaguely remember, even when I was very young, going to church and
   peeking out from between my clasped hands when people were praying.  I
   remember watching them and thinking, “They’re playing make believe.
   They’re not talking to God, they’re talking to each other…”  As I got
   older, I realized the heresy of such a thought, and I stomped it down
   DEEP.  I put all of my energy into getting right with Jesus.  (Those of
   you who have spent any time on twitter know that I have energy to spare
   NOW — just imagine what I was like THEN).  I made god my raison
   d’etre.  I did everything I was told — and everything I could think of
   on my own — to get him to talk to me.  He never did.  As much as I like
   to hear myself talk, I hung up about 25 years ago, and it has made all
   the difference for me.

   So, there you have it.  I am a deviant — different from the norm in a
   multitude of ways.  So, why am I telling you this?  What’s the point?
   Here’s the point:  Everything I have said is true, but so is this…

   I don’t want to outlaw shopping or shut down the malls.
   I don’t think people who like to shop are bad.

   I don’t want to outlaw expensive cars like Lexus, BMW, and Mercedes.
   I don’t think that people who own expensive cars are bad.

   I don’t want to outlaw boxing, or lock up boxers or boxing spectators.
   I don’t think liking boxing, or making boxing your career, is bad.

   I don’t want to pass a law to make people adjust their clocks to suit
   me.
   I don’t think being awake during the day and sleeping at night is bad.

   I don’t want to outlaw barbers, or cosmetologists, or scissors, or
   baldness.
   I don’t think having or liking short hair, or no hair, is bad.

   I don’t want to outlaw sports, or sportscasts, or sports reporters.
   I don’t think that liking sports, or making sports your career, is bad.
   (Dave Zirin, I’d make out with you on principle. Also, ‘cuz you’re
   wicked hot.)

   I don’t want to outlaw parenting.
   I don’t think that being a parent is bad.

   I don’t want to outlaw god, or prayer, or churches.
   I don’t think that people who believe in god are bad.

   That is what makes me a liberal.  As a liberal, I know I have my own
   personal opinions, my own personal preferences, and my own personal
   tastes, and I know that is ALL THEY ARE.  I know that other people can
   have different opinions, preferences and tastes, and they don’t
   threaten mine.  I know other people can make different choices, and
   they don’t diminish mine.  I don’t believe that there is only one right
   choice to make for everyone.  I respect and appreciate diversity.  I
   don’t want the government taking sides — even if the side they take is
   mine.  I don’t want to be told people who are different than me are
   wrong or bad.  I want the freedom to make up my own mind, and I want
   you to have that freedom, too.

   Here is what I DON’T want to hear from my government ANYMORE:

   If you’re not straight, you’re bad.

   If you don’t believe in god(s), any god(s), or the most popular god(s),
   you’re bad.

   If you weren’t raised in a two-parent family (whatever the hell that
   means when they say it) you had a bad childhood; your
   (grand/non-traditional/absent military) parent(s) is/was are/were bad.

   If you don’t have children of your own, you’re bad.

   If you don’t get married, whether or not we’ll let you, to a person of
   whom WE approve, you’re bad.

   As a liberal, I don’t want society cleansed of people that are
   different than me, or that make different choices.  I don’t want a
   homogeneous society.  I don’t want everyone to be JUST LIKE ME.  I
   don’t want the government to make it easy to be me, and tough to be
   you; to say it’s right to be me, and wrong to be you.  As a liberal, I
   know the difference between an opinion and a fact, and I want the
   government to stick to facts.  I want the gray areas left alone.  I
   want to make up my own mind. I want to be free to be who I am, believe
   what I believe, like what I like, say what I say, love who I love, and
   live how I live.  I want the same thing for you.

   And in case you’re wondering? Bullet holes in dead children are not a
   gray area.

   I may not want kids, but I want kids to live.
