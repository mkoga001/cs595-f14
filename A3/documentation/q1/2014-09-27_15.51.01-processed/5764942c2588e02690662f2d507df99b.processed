            Truths about 1080

            DOC’s Battle For Our Birds campaign has been labelled
            ‘controversial’ by many news outlets because of the proposed
            increase in the use of the poison 1080.

            But when you look at the facts and speak to people who really
            understand how the poison works, there’s little controversy
            about its effectiveness or the threat posed to humans and
            native birds.
            In its February 2014 issue, Wilderness magazine put 10
            commonly held beliefs about 1080 to three independent experts,
            who responded with what is currently known about the toxin,
            rather than with rumours and anecdotes.

            threat to our endangered native wildlife is being predicted by
            scientists this autumn.
            High levels of seed production ('mast') in our beech forests
            is expected to trigger a rodent and stoat explosion later this
            year. When seed supplies run out these predators will turn on
            endangered birds such as mōhua, kākā, kea, whio and kiwi along
            with other at risk species like bats and land snails.
            To protect our native wildlife the Department of Conservation
            (DOC) is implementing the 'Battle for our Birds' predator
            control programme. DOC will extend the South Island forest
            areas targeted for aerial protection with biodegradable 1080
            pesticide and boost ground based trapping networks.

            Do you genuinely care about keeping New Zealand clean and
            green, but don't know who and what to believe when it comes to
            1080? If you want to know the science-based facts about 1080 -
            what it is, why it's used and exactly what it does - take a
            moment to read these facts.
         What is 1080?
            1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) is a naturally-occurring toxin
            found in many plants throughout the world. Plants have
            developed it as a natural defence against browsing mammals.
            The active ingredient in 1080 is found naturally in tea and
            testing at one site showed it also appears to occur in
            puha.^[17]1 It is manufactured for use in various types of
            baits for pest control operations and is highly toxic to
            mammals in particular.
            What does it do to the environment?
            1080 is highly water soluble and breaks down in the
            environment into harmless substances.[18]^2 It does not
            accumulate in the food chain or in the soil.[19]^3 Any animal
            ingesting a sub-lethal dose of 1080 will metabolise and
            eliminate the substance within 10 days.[20]^4
            Why is it used in New Zealand?
            1080 has been used on a small scale in a number of countries,
            including Australia, the United States and the Galapagos
            Islands (Equador)[21]^5, but its use has been limited because
            of the need in these countries to protect native mammals.  New
            Zealand, however, unlike almost all other countries, has no
            native land mammals (except bats)[22]^6, but a very large
            number of introduced, highly destructive mammalian pests,
            including possums, rabbits, rats, stoats, ferrets and feral
            cats.[23]^7

            Enemy number one
            All of these pests have devastating effects on New Zealand's
            native plants, animals and ecosystems, so conservation is a
            major motive behind the country's pest control strategy.  But
            enemy number one is also a threat to our  pastoral farming,
            because the possum is the host and carrier of a lethal
            disease, bovine TB.

            Our natural environment: easy prey for predators
            New Zealand's unique flora and fauna is highly vulnerable: it
            evolved over 80 million years with no browsing or predatory
            mammals. So it's hardly surprising that introduced mammalian
            pests - brought here either to be domesticated, by accident,
            for hunting, for the fur trade, or to control other introduced
            pests – have driven some of our most vulnerable species to the
            brink of extinction.

            Killers of the night
            Possums, rats, ferrets, stoats and feral cats all kill both
            adult birds and chicks and raid nests for eggs.[25]^8 They
            also compete for, and wipe out, critical food sources for
            birds such as supplies of berries, flowers, fruits and
            invertebrates.  Predators are blamed for an estimated 61%
            (26,628,940) of chick and egg losses every year.[26]^9
            These predators prey on native species that are:
                 - in immediate danger of extinction: mohua, southern New
            Zealand dotteral and kakariki
                 - acutely threatened: rowi/okarito brown kiwi, kaka and
            North Island kokako
                 - nationally critical: several species of giant New
            Zealand snail, Powelliphanta, and
                 - common species: tui, bellbird, fantail and
            whitehead.[27]^10
            Introduced pests have also devastated our forest canopy and
            stripped vast tracts of native bush.  Rata, kamahi,
            pohutukawa, mistletoe and fuchsia are particularly badly
            affected.[28]^11
            Aerial 1080
            It is our unique lack of native land mammals than enables New
            Zealand to use 1080 aerially, and this has now become a vital
            tool in the battle to control introduced pests and protect New
            Zealand's native species.  There have been numerous examples
            of highly successful operations involving the threatened
            species listed above (see the [29]C[30]ase studies section for
            some examples).
            The 'triple predator' benefit
            Aerial 1080 operations involving pre-feeding of baits are also
            increasingly reliable in achieving high kills not only of
            possums but also rats and stoats via secondary poisioning.
            This 'triple hit' of the three major bird predators over a
            large area provides a breeding 'window' for the following
            season that is crucial to increasing female and chick
            survival.
            Protecting our grasslands
            1080 is also a key weapon in the ongoing battle against
            rabbits, which are now becoming resistant to rabbit
            hemorrhagic disease (RHD).  Farmers and land managers are
            having to increase their use of 1080 to protect pastoral land
            from rabbits and preserve the gains made in recent years
            through the use of RHD.[31]^12
            Bovine tuberculosis (TB)
            Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a serious, highly infectious
            disease found in cattle and deer herds, causing weight loss
            and death.
            Possums are the main source and carrier of bovine TB in New
            Zealand, and the main self-sustaining reservoir of the disease
            in the wild.  In the early 1970s, it was discovered that
            possums were the source of chronic infection in cattle herds.
            Bovine tuberculosis infection transfers relatively easily from
            possums to cattle and deer due to the proximity of farmland to
            bush areas in New Zealand.  Possums are responsible for around
            80% of new infection in cattle and deer herds.
            Possum with TB lesion (Source: AHB)
            Bovine TB is a major threat to our economy
            Dairy and meat exports are worth more than $12 billion
            annually to New Zealand. Rising international animal health
            standards and growing concern about food safety are now major
            factors governing and threatening access to premium overseas
            markets.
            Many of our trading competitors, including Australia, are
            classed as being free of disease.[32]^13 As at August 2009,
            New Zealand had 0.35%[33]^14 of cattle and deer herds infected
            with bovine tuberculosis. This equates to around 131 herds. As
            a nation with bovine TB infection, New Zealand is banned from
            exporting live cattle and deer to TB-free countries, including
            North America and Australia.
            Through a nationally coordinated programme comprising ground
            and aerial control methods and TB-testing cattle and deer, the
            Animal Health Board (AHB) (the agency charged with controlling
            bovine tuberculosis in New Zealand) has, in the past decade
            reduced the number of TB-infected herds by more than 90%.
            Aerial 1080 operations account for less than 20% of the AHB's
            control programme, which also uses traps and a range of pest
            control toxins.
            If AHB's bovine TB eradication programme were to stop, the
            potential cost to New Zealand as a country has been estimated
            at $5 billion over 10 years.[34]^15 AHB is on track to reach
            the internationally recognised target for official TB freedom
            of 0.2% infected cattle and deer herds by 2013.
            Some facts about 1080 operations
            1080 is the only toxin currently registered for use on
            mainland New Zealand as suitable for aerial targeting of
            possums.
            Aerial application of 1080 using helicopters is a carefully
            planned process, targeting and avoiding specific areas and
            boundries using GPS technology.[35]^16 Aerial targeting is an
            essential part of the strategy for reaching areas that are
            inaccessible or dangerous by land, and protecting TB-free
            areas throughout the country by creating an effective buffer
            zone from TB-infected areas.
            Ground-based operations are used in about two thirds of the
            areas where AHB, the Department of Conservation (DOC) and
            regional councils have identified that possum control is
            neccessary.  Very strict notification procedures are followed
            prior to all 1080 operations, including the approval of the
            local public Medical Officer of Health.[36]^17
            Dogs are very vulnerable to 1080, up to ten times more so than
            other animals.  Dog owners are warned to keep their dogs well
            away from 1080-treated areas.
            In spite of careful procedures, including extensive
            signposting, occasional dog deaths do occur.  Where there is
            any possible risk, muzzles should be used to protect dogs from
            eating baits or poisoned carcasses. If a dog inadvertently
            ingests 1080, it should be taken to a vet immediately.
            Acetamide has proven an effective emetic and should be
            administered as soon as possible.[37]^18 Farmed mammals and
            other introduced domestic mammals are also vulnerable to 1080
            if they gain access to the baits.
            While DOC, AHB and regional councils are all bound by very
            strict operational regulations and procedures, from time to
            time accidental poisoning of non-target animals does occur.
            Avoiding such incidents is a high priority goal and to this
            end protocols and operating practices are subject to rigorous
            review and continuous improvement.
            The organisations that use 1080 have always been very
            concerned to ensure that it effectively targets the introduced
            pests and has minimal impact on native species which they are
            trying to protect.  For example, 30 years ago a standard
            operation used around 30kg of un-dyed carrot bait per
            hectare.  Today a standard operation would use between 1.5kg
            and 3kg of dyed ceral bait.  Landcare is carrying out research
            for DOC and AHB to reduce the sowing rate down to just 0.25kg
            per hectare.[38]^19
            Alternatives to 1080
            The supporters of this website are also supportive of ongoing
            research into finding alternative methods of controlling
            possums and other mammalian pests.  If we had a choice we
            would not use some of the toxins that are used to control
            target pests.   Use of any type of toxin involves ethical
            issues and trade-offs, for example with regard to its
            humaneness relative to its effectiveness and also the
            suffering target pests inflict on their prey.  Unfortunately,
            effective solutions involve tough choices, particularly when
            we are dealing with a major, human-induced threat to our
            biodiversity and our economy.   We have to choose between
            feeding native and often rare species to introduced pests, or
            killing the pests so that the native species can survive.  We
            have the same issues with regard to protecting our stock from
            Bovine TB.  We have international as well as national
            responsibilities to ensure survival of our native species and
            to protect our farms from disease, and no one can fulfil those
            responsibilities on our behalf.
            Scientists, farmers and conservationists are widely united in
            the view that for now, 1080 is the best solution we have, and
            until such time as an effective alternative is found, it must
            remain a key component of New Zealand’s overall pest control
            strategy.
            The ERMA Review
            The Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA), is New
            Zealand's independent public watch dog, and is charged with
            analysing all actual and perceived risks and perceived risks
            to the New Zealand environment.  During 2007 ERMA undertook a
            rigorous, comprehensive review of 1080, including a series of
            nationwide public hearings. All interested parties were
            invited to present written and oral submissions to an
            independent committee.  The committee spent four months of
            intensive deliberation, which included an independent analysis
            of all the scientific data.  ERMA concluded that the benefits
            of using 1080 clearly outweighed the risks, and approved its
            continued use in aerial and ground applications, subject to
            strict controls.[39]^20

            Studies
            The effectiveness and safety of 1080 as we use it in New
            Zealand has been the subject of many studies and extensive
            published scientific research over the past 30 years.
            Some key findings
         Water
            Between 1990 and 2008 extensive water monitoring (2098
            samples)[41]^21 was undertaken after a large number of aerial
            1080 operations.  This was a requirement of the Ministry of
            Health and more recently has been required for ERMA watchlist
            reporting purposes.  The following are examples from the
            programme:
                 -  After 34 different aerial 1080 operations in the
            Wanganui area between 1990 and 2008, 76 water tests found no
            trace of 1080 in any domestic reticulated water
            supplies.[42]^22
                 - In 2006, a set of trials was conducted in four streams
            on the West Coast, using 10 times the number of 1080 baits
            that might normally be expected to enter streams during aerial
            treatment.  These trials showed that even this large number of
            baits had no detectable effect on aquatic life in
            streams.[43]^23
            The conclusion of this extensive water monitoring programme
            was that there is no risk to human health from the aerial 1080
            operations currently being undertaken in New Zealand.
            [44]Watch a video about water testing here
            Food chain
                - Trials show that 1080 is rapidly biodegraded by aquatic
            and land plants, and by micro-organisms in water and
            soils.[45]^24
                 - Trials also show that animals ingesting sub-lethal
            doses of 1080 rapidly excrete the poison or metabolise it into
            non-toxic products.  All traces of the poison in live animals
            are gone within 10 days.[46]^25
                 - Fish were fed 1080 baits in separate studies in the
            United States and New Zealand.  Of the fish tested in both
            trials, 100 percent survived and none showed any ill
            effects.[47]^26
                 - Sausages containing levels of 1080 comparable to those
            found in a 1080-poisoned possum carcass were also fed to eels
            in the New Zealand study.  After eating all of the sausages,
            all of the eels survived and none became ill.  The eels
            rapidly eliminated the toxin from their bodies.[48]^27
            Bird populations
                 - DOC monitors bird populations and bush health following
            1080 applications in many parts of the country.  Long-term
            assessments demonstrate that native bird populations are not
            damaged by 1080, and indeed that most native bird species show
            net benefits, especially from the impact of the 'triple
            predator' by-kill effect of aerial 1080, referred to above.
            The benefits for native bird populations of effectively taking
            out three major predators at once are in some cases
            spectacular.[49]^28
                 - Some inadvertent by-kill of native birds has been
            recorded, but is more than made up for by the subsequent
            increase in populations.  Kea deaths recorded on the West
            Coast in 2008 are, however, of real concern, and the
            Department of Conservation is working with the Kea
            Conservation Trust on extensive research to determine how to
            prevent this recurring in future.[50]^29
            Insect populations
                 - Monitoring of ground-based insect populations show
            minimal loss of insect life from 1080, and increase after
            aerial 1080 targeting as a result of reduced insect predation
            from introduced mammalian predators.[51]^30
