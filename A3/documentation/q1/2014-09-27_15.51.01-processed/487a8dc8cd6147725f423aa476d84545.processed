[8]Indestructible Locksmith

   Posted on [9]26.08.2014 by [10]qin2312

   We don’t have the same flesh and blood.
   We neither come from the same country nor speak same language.
   However, we still find each other so familiar. With a simple greeting,
   we get close to each other without hesitation.

   The memories about Locksmith was “forever & always” precious to me. I
   will bring all of them with me till the end of my life. For me, people
   who claim themselve as a “Locksmith”, as a crew on the TaeNy’s ship,
   are brave people. I sincerely mean what I said . You know that shipping
   an ordinary couple is hard enough to give up anytime, but this is TaeNy
   who we are talking about.

   TaeNy is a couple giving me a disorientation, a good one, whenever they
   stare at each other eyes. I always wonder why TaeNy stands out so
   different and special. People said TaeNy was just a fanservice, but
   Locksmith did not think so, even not any couple in Soshi was
   fanservice. You cannot put a 7 years friendship of Soshi’s members to
   the same scale with the cheap “fanservice”.

   When Soshi’s members hug each other, they really mean what they do. So,
   what is the point? The point is TaeNy seldom gives each other a
   “friend-called” embrace like they do with other members while still
   claiming themselves as the best buddies in Soshi. Best friends get shy
   when giving a slight and simple hug to each other?

   Locksmith finds out our own truth and believe in it. No matter what
   public shows to us, we still keep a hope seed and take care of it with
   love and faith to a day, when it grows up to be a strong hope tree with
   healthy root. Who needs others to show us what the truth is. The truth
   is not a thing which others can put it on you, but you need to find
   your own one.

   Like a ship run into an angry storm on dark sea, If the crews do not
   give up and keep doing their best to protect their ship, the ship
   surely will board safe and sound.

   Everything is temporariness, even our lives, but memories can follow us
   to the last moment of our lives. Let’s be proud of ourself in a day
   when we look back. The moment when we realize that we had met many
   great people and been brave to put 100% belief in thing which people
   thought unbelievable.

   ^_^

   Happy TaeNy Day
