		<p>This time next week it will be October.</p>
<p>Just take a moment and let that sink in. 7 days from today will be October, 91 days until Christmas, and 98 days until 2015. I&#8217;m in disbelief just typing that&#8230; Where has the time gone? I swear I fell asleep in September of last year and woke up to have the first exams of my junior year today. (2 of them and a quiz, to be exact.) It&#8217;s been a crazy hectic few weeks, and maybe that&#8217;s why it feels like they&#8217;ve been a complete blur. Between races at Churchill Downs, Pi Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma prefs and KD Shamrock n&#8217; Run, the blur has at least been an absolutely fun-filled adventure.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something about being stressed that I&#8217;m just not good at. (Are any of us?) But when I say I&#8217;m not good at it&#8230; I tend to bottle my feelings up for the sake of productivity and perfectionism, and when they become too much to handle &#8211; watch out. It&#8217;s like a levee breaks and all hell just breaks loose. This time it was more than just a little stress about a few exams, friendship frustrations, or even homesickness. No, not quite. This time when the bottle of feelings bubbled over, it brought way more than I was expecting with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the first that I struggle with the process of letting go. Not necessarily with any one thing in particular, but with many aspects of my life. I&#8217;ve never really known how to say &#8220;No.&#8221; It&#8217;s a huge weakness of mine, and truthfully not one I&#8217;ve gotten much better at with age. I&#8217;m a giver, I feel so obliged to do things for people when they are asked of me that I sometimes forget to take care of myself as well. When I have to make a decision, I&#8217;m much more compelled to consider the feelings of others with more weight than I do my own.</p>
<p>Off and on over the past six months I&#8217;ve been doing just that &#8211; forgetting to take care of myself. I&#8217;ve been so wrapped up in trying to make friendships and relationships work (that honestly were DOA), that I&#8217;ve lost sight of the bigger picture. In the midst of a nervous breakdown over all of my responsibilities, it all suddenly seemed so clear that I couldn&#8217;t believe I couldn&#8217;t see it all along. I finally realized that maybe there is some truth in the saying, &#8220;If you&#8217;re at rock bottom, be grateful &#8211; for there&#8217;s no where to go but up.&#8221; I arguably haven&#8217;t been at rock bottom, but I&#8217;ll be the first to admit the past few months have been a rocky road to say the least.</p>
<p>Perhaps what was even harder for me to accept than the fact I was the one putting myself back in this situation over and over again by running from my problems, was the realization that the people trying so hard to help me move past it were more so encouraging me to fall back into the same trap. I had been telling my friends I needed closure. &#8220;I need closure,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I need closure and I&#8217;ll finally be able to move past this and on with my life.&#8221; But in the process of seeking that closure, I was just running from my problems when I needed to face them head on.</p>
<p>I stumbled across a quote by one of my favorite authors, John Green, who many of you probably know from &#8220;The Fault In Our Stars.&#8221; He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>&#8220;So often we try to make other people feel better by minimizing their pain, by telling them that it will get better (which it will) or that there are worse things in the world (which there are). But that&#8217;s not what I actually needed.</em> <em>What I actually needed was for someone to tell me that it hurt because it mattered. I have found this very useful to think about over the years, and I find that it is a lot easier and more bearable to be sad when you aren&#8217;t constantly berating yourself for being sad.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Those words hit so incredibly close to home it almost took my breath away. In more wise words from Green, &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing about pain, it demands to be felt.&#8221; Instead of running from my pain and my problems, it was time to face them head on. And he was right about one thing&#8230; It hurt.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">But, a funny thing happened. I woke up one morning with a smile on my face, which is a rarity on a day I&#8217;m <strong>not</strong> waking up at 7:15AM. I had a picnic and went to church with my sisters, and had one of the best days I&#8217;ve had in months. I made the decision that I didn&#8217;t have time for someone who has been lying to me and putting me through the ringer. I deleted the number of a toxic heartbreaker. While every day hasn&#8217;t been a good day, they haven&#8217;t all been bad either. Each one is a little bit better than the last.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;m not crazy enough to believe that what worked for me will work for everyone, but I <strong>can</strong> guarantee one thing that will work for every single person.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Baby steps</span>. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">You don&#8217;t have to be okay again all at once, and no one should expect you to be. (If they do, don&#8217;t be ashamed to have a few choice words for them). But, a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, even if it is just a baby step.</p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who watches SportsCenter religiously every morning, maybe just get ScoreCenter news updates sent to your phone, or really honestly if you don&#8217;t just live under a rock &#8211; you&#8217;ve heard about the recent scandal involving the Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. If you haven&#8217;t&#8230; You need to get out more. But basically he has been indicted by a grand jury in Texas on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child. Needless to say &#8211; child abuse is one of the hottest topics in the media right now.</p>
<p>For those of you who might not follow news outside of major headlines quite as closely, you might not have heard about the uproar that has taken place in a small northwest Pennsylvania town over the past few months. A seven year old boy was found starved and beaten in my county, weighing only 25 pounds. Quotes from doctors in various news outlets say that he resembled a Holocaust victim, and that he was approximately a month from death. Support for the little boy outpoured from not only the Greenville community and surrounding areas, but from across the nation as it garnered support from news outlets such as Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, NY Daily News, and CNN.</p>
<p>I guess what I&#8217;m trying to get at here is that child abuse is all around us. It doesn&#8217;t just happen in the news, it doesn&#8217;t just happen in big cities, it happens everywhere. Child abuse is all around us &#8211; and could even be occurring to children you know.</p>
<p>Three years ago I joined Kappa Delta sorority, and part of the reason I fell so in love with KD during recruitment were our philanthropies. As a national organization, we work closely with both Girl Scouts and Prevent Child Abuse America. I didn&#8217;t know much about PCAA back then, but this organization has quickly found its way to becoming very near and dear to my heart. Every year, Kappa Delta chapters across the nation are expected to hold a &#8220;Shamrock&#8221; philanthropy event to benefit PCAA, and right here in Louisville Alpha Xi is no exception.</p>
<p>Prevent Child Abuse America was founded in 1981 by a KD Alumnae, Donna Stone, and we have been supporting the cause since day one. My chapter works hard to raise money to benefit not only national PCAA, but also the Kentucky division, Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky. <em>Kentucky leads the nation in child abuse and neglect</em>, and in 2012 16,939 Kentucky children fell victim to child abuse. Keep in mind though, that&#8217;s just here in Kentucky. Nationwide in 2012, 686,000 children were victims of child abuse. 1,640 innocent children lost their lives due to child abuse and neglect. And even scarier? 70.3% of those children who died were under the age of 3.</p>
<p><strong>Too many victims of child abuse can&#8217;t speak for themselves. That&#8217;s where we come in. </strong></p>

<p>This coming Sunday, September 18, 2014, KD Alpha Xi will be hosting our 9th Annual Shamrock &#8216;n Run 5K at Iroquois Park here in Louisville. Our proceeds will directly benefit both PCAA and PCAK, organizations that “have led the way in building awareness, providing education and inspiring hope to everyone involved in the effort to prevent the abuse and neglect of our nation&#8217;s children.” Participants can expect a fun-filled afternoon complete with music, refreshments, and even a kid&#8217;s run this year. But &#8211; the best part of all is clearly spending time with their favorite Kappa Deltas and raising money for the kids!</p>

		<p>Football season is back, and all is right in my world again. (Well, as much as it can ever really be when it&#8217;s me we&#8217;re talking about.) This Monday was Louisville&#8217;s season opener, as well as our first ACC game. And believe me when I say it lived up to the hype. While we were all too proud to say so, we all &#8211; myself included &#8211; were a little nervous about what the outcome of the game was going to be. New coach, new quarterback, new and harder conference&#8230; It&#8217;s enough to make anyone a little anxious. But our Cards pulled through, and once again left me crying in my seat. </p>
<p>If you were lucky enough to attend a university with a football program that has a big place in the hearts and lives of its fans, you know just how necessary the art of tailgating is. No offense to my homeland in the North, y&#8217;all go hard, but in comparison &#8211; nothing beats a tailgate in the South. Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I get it that my school isn&#8217;t SEC. But I&#8217;ve been to SEC tailgates, and the ACC is a pretty honorable second. I couldn&#8217;t help but reminisce over my first ever tailgate this weekend, and just how completely starry-eyed it left me. I&#8217;ve always loved football, but tailgate is the cream cheese frosting on my favorite pineapple cake. </p>
<p><a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/556571_10151054822235488_2064233162_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-268" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/556571_10151054822235488_2064233162_n.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="556571_10151054822235488_2064233162_n" width="225" height="300" /></a> <a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/10626500_10152379662320488_9191401063586284151_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-267" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/10626500_10152379662320488_9191401063586284151_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="10626500_10152379662320488_9191401063586284151_n" width="300" height="300" /><br /></a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t follow me on Twitter, you missed out on some real quality live-tweets about the game. Just for future reference, you can keep up with me at <a title="here" href="https://twitter.com/miss_knierman" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/miss_knierman</a>. Most of my best ones didn&#8217;t even post (or save to my drafts for that matter, which left me more than a little salty), but here is a glimpse into just how happy my little heart was watching my team beat Miami. <strong>Again. </strong>IT&#8217;S JUST SO MUCH FUN TO SAY WE BEAT THEM AGAIN. Also, I apologize to my future husband, but I&#8217;m not sure how a man could ever make me happier than football. That&#8217;s just the God&#8217;s honest truth. </p>
<p><a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-10-43-54-am.png"><img class="wp-image-269 aligncenter" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-10-43-54-am.png?w=422&#038;h=230" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-03 at 10.43.54 AM" width="422" height="230" /></a>Like I said before, it was our first official ACC football game since joining the conference on July 1st of this year. Our schedule is going to be a tough one, and I can&#8217;t wait to see how we measure up to the rest of the conference. Especially on October 30, when we play FSU here in Louisville. I confidently speak for the rest of my peers when I say The Birdcage is ready to take on the rest of the season completely headstrong. If you have any doubts about that, you clearly live under a rock and haven&#8217;t seen the photos of our student section on Monday. (This would be the part of the game you can imagine me shedding tears.) From my very first tailgate, which was a game against our biggest rival &#8211; UK, to watching my boys tear Florida apart after ringing in 2013 in New Orleans, to this week watching them beat all the odds and come up in the Top 25 poll this week it feels like I&#8217;ve watched my best friend finally living the dream. But in a way, that&#8217;s exactly what I have done.</p>
<p>Louisville is one of those places that you don&#8217;t just attend for four years and move on. It&#8217;s not one of those colleges with ho-hum athletic programs and a so-so fan base. When we say &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s a place that can get into your blood and stay forever</em>,&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean it lightly. First you become a part of it, then it becomes a part of you. In high school, I never understood how people were so attached to their schools and their sports teams&#8230; I just didn&#8217;t get it. Now I do. Now I finally understand what it feels like to share this with 55,427 of my &#8220;closest friends&#8221;. And yes, the picture below is our student section. Is this how we ACC?</p>
<p><a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/10471229_10152718906538856_7505424762334142173_n.jpg"><img class="wp-image-271 aligncenter" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/10471229_10152718906538856_7505424762334142173_n.jpg?w=360&#038;h=360" alt="10471229_10152718906538856_7505424762334142173_n" width="360" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>While I love my Cardinals, and I&#8217;m a million times more avid of a supporter of college athletics than professional (which is way easier when your personal friends are the ones out there living the dream), I still have a special place in my heart for NFL football. And by NFL, I mean the Dallas Cowboys &#8211; obviously. Today the Cowboys announced that upon passing his physical, Michael Sam would be given a place within the organization. Despite my reactions to ESPN&#8217;s (over) coverage of Sam being the first openly gay player in the NFL, I couldn&#8217;t be prouder to see him join my team. Not because he is openly gay, but because he is a damn good football player and will be a good fit for the team. Nonetheless, I admire him greatly for leading the pack in an industry where masculinity is seen as an end-all, be-all. No one bats an eyelash if an African-American joins the league, and in my opinion, an openly gay player is no different. We&#8217;re all human, is that so hard to see? If Ray Rice can get a two-game suspension for beating his wife and dragging her around unconscious, but seeing an openly gay player is such an uproar, it&#8217;s time for us to reevaluate our priorities. In any case, welcome home, Michael. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-11-12-38-am.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-272" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-11-12-38-am.png?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-03 at 11.12.38 AM" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">While the Cowboys are my team, I obviously could never forget my one true QB love &#8211; Teddy. Who, might I add, bought an entire page of our school newspaper to print an ad thanking the university for all of their support here. I think my favorite Teddy story was seeing him walk across campus, and with just a &#8220;Hey Dallas!&#8221; &#8220;Hey Teddy, good luck this weekend!&#8221; conversation, an innocent bystander questioned why I wished that random guy good luck this weekend and called him Teddy. And I had to explain to him that it was indeed our quarterback, and not a random 16 year old with braces&#8230; Or maybe getting the chance to sit and chat with his mom and CJ Gaines&#8217; mom in Philadelphia at Temple. I really just can&#8217;t wait to see what this world has to offer him. Louisville first, Cardinals forever. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/securedownload.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-273" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/securedownload.jpg?w=300&#038;h=265" alt="securedownload" width="300" height="265" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;m also playing Fantasy Football this year, so wish me luck y&#8217;all. If I win, I plan to use it to woo Tim Tebow into falling in love with me. So we&#8217;ll see how that works out for Team Victorious Secret, because if not I&#8217;m going to need a backup plan. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s Thursday, and the first week of my junior year here at UofL is almost in the books &#8211; what literally might have been the longest week of my life. I once heard someone compare junior year to a Thursday night, the beginning of the end. I&#8217;m not sure I could have put it any better myself. Thursdays are so bittersweet &#8211; we treat them as a weekend because we&#8217;re in college and can &#8220;sleep when we&#8217;re dead&#8221;, but then we&#8217;re smacked in the face with the reminder that we still have a whole day of classes left between us and the weekend. But at the same time, we&#8217;re already worrying about Monday and what the &#8220;real world&#8221; has to bring to the table. Just food for thought. </p>
<p>I fall in the &#8220;sleep when I&#8217;m dead&#8221; category, and as of today I haven&#8217;t had a day off between work and Kappa Delta since August 2nd. Needless to say I&#8217;ve been running pretty ragged, and am more than thankful for the few sweet hours I have in breaks between class and my other responsibilities. You can imagine that there have been a few breakdowns (mental, emotional, nervous) that have ensued throughout the past three weeks &#8211; but here I am, I&#8217;m still alive. </p>
<p>Formal recruitment was a HUGE success for Kappa Delta, as we added <strong>fifty</strong> new members to our loving sisterhood. Yeah, you read that right, 5-0 new KD&#8217;s! Just to give you a run down of how Greek rush works in these parts, potential new members/rushees (PNM&#8217;s) attend parties at each chapter for four nights, all leading up to Bid Day. The first night each chapter focuses on finances and leadership, the second is for highlighting the chapter&#8217;s philanthropy(ies), a skit exemplifying what the chapter is all about is performed on the third night, and the final night is known as &#8220;Preference&#8221; and is just a monster of its own &#8211; where PNM&#8217;s get a glimpse into the chapter&#8217;s sisterhood. I pretty much eat, sleep, and breathe for skit night during recruitment. This year we worked so incredibly hard on our skit, and I&#8217;ll be honest, I shed a few tears after our last party knowing that it was worth every second. Preference is my other favorite night, as it was the night I knew Kappa Delta was my home. </p>

<p>Waiting for Bid Day was like waiting for Santa to come on Christmas as a kid, I can never sleep waiting to see what amazing women we&#8217;ll be welcoming into our chapter the next afternoon. Like I said before, this year we welcomed fifty new members and I couldn&#8217;t think of better women to join our chapter &#8211; they&#8217;re all just as whacky and fun as we are. Our theme was &#8220;Drafting the Best: Welcome Home KΔdets&#8221; and it was even highlighted on our National Headquarter&#8217;s Instagram! I had an absolute blast extending my &#8220;Rush Crush&#8221; family and celebrating with my sisters. </p>
<p> <a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/10626480_10152346029455488_7054114079612861052_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-250" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/10626480_10152346029455488_7054114079612861052_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=296" alt="10626480_10152346029455488_7054114079612861052_n" width="300" height="296" /></a><a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/10593075_10152346035115488_2449176537918644901_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-252" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/10593075_10152346035115488_2449176537918644901_n.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="10593075_10152346035115488_2449176537918644901_n" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The only bad thing about recruitment being over is that that calls for the beginning of school&#8230; But not without one weekend of fun and relaxation of course! Seeing all my friends back in Louisville (and celebrating my roomie&#8217;s 21st birthday) was the best way I could have ever asked for to spend my last weekend of summer. Despite the heat advisory and sweat of course.. As much as I grumble and whine about school, I secretly was glad to be back at work again and for the thought of getting back into a schedule and routine. I&#8217;m Type A to the max, and while I thrive on being busy, I would lose my mind if I didn&#8217;t have a set schedule &#8211; so spontaneous weekend fun keeps me on my toes!</p>

<p>Much to all of our chagrin, classes started this past Monday. Now, if only I had a dollar for every time I&#8217;ve been teased for rambling about how excited I am over my classes this semester &#8211; I probably could at least pay for my books. Every semester I&#8217;ve spent in the Political Science department has solidified in my mind that I&#8217;m doing exactly what I was meant to come to college and learn. Most people can&#8217;t imagine sitting through classes examining political campaign and voting statistics, discussing international conflicts and organizations, or learning (attempting) Deutsch &#8211; but I can&#8217;t imagine anything else I would rather be studying. Plus, I&#8217;m taking a yoga course this semester, so maybe that will help with my stress levels. Every little bit helps, right?</p>
<p>On top of all the pressure that comes with starting out on the right foot in classes and making a good impression on professors, I&#8217;ve been feeling pretty anxious about where my life is headed. Am I on the right track? Am I making the right connections? Where will I be this time next year, in two years, in ten years? As I said&#8230; Breakdowns have been just kind of expected. But it&#8217;s like the universe always seems to know what I need, and I happened to stumble across this quote this morning on my walk to class, in the sweltering heat, after a slight moment of thinking I lost my keys&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>&#8220;I am learning every day to allow the space between where I am and where I want to be to inspire me and not terrify me.&#8221;</em> <em>- Tracee Ellis Ross</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After reading that I kind of just wanted to get down to business and defeat the Huns, like let&#8217;s be real. But in all seriousness, I have a feeling that if this week has been any indication, this year is going to be the toughest yet. It&#8217;s going to kick my ass, and it&#8217;s going to open my eyes. I just keep telling myself that &#8220;what doesn&#8217;t kill you makes you stronger&#8221; (or blonder, in the case of both Miranda Lambert and me). Until then, I&#8217;ll be living off my fall break countdown, which is at 37 days in case you were wondering, college football, and pumpkin spice lattes. Oh, and the air conditioning unit perched in my window, because it&#8217;s August in Kentucky and homegirl isn&#8217;t trying to die of a heat stroke. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I grew up in an incredibly small town in Western Pennsylvania that I couldn&#8217;t wait to get out of.</p>
<p>I grew up in a town that was too small for me, that suffocated me. A town full of bigots, hypocrites and cowards. The place where &#8220;muppears&#8221; came for the summer, and we cursed them every day until the fall turned everything crisp yet again. A one-building school district of a little over 500, and a &#8220;high school&#8221; of a little less than 300. I hail from the Snow Belt, where it isn&#8217;t uncommon to get three feet of snow overnight &#8211; <i>and still have school the next day.</i> Imagine that.</p>
<p>I grew up in a confused little town. A town where there was a clear line defining the city-slicker wannabes, and the kids who got offended when someone would wear camouflage to school because they weren&#8217;t &#8220;country&#8221; enough. I attended sporting events where <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we didn&#8217;t have enough athletes to field a full team</span>, let alone win a game or be recruited to a college above the DII level. Where the other team&#8217;s taunts included retorts about tractors, trucks, and cows.</p>
<p>I grew up in a farm town that struggled to embrace the &#8220;farm&#8221; life. Well, kind of. A town where house parties were non-existent, and you had to have a 4WD (or a friend with one) to get to parties thrown in fields. But <b>redneck</b> was the most offensive title someone could have. The place you could leave 15 minutes early for school to get help on Calculus homework, and be 45 minutes late because you had to help the neighbors round up their cows. I know this for a fact, because it happened to me.</p>
<p>I grew up in a town where no one ever really leaves. A town where people go to college, generally within 2-3 hours of home, and come back. A community where several of the teachers I had, also taught my dad. Where you could never do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">anything</span>, good or bad, without your parents finding out before you had a chance to tell them. I would leave work at night sometimes to find notes on my car, simply because everyone can identify everyone else&#8217;s <i>everything.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>I grew up, and I left that sleepy little town. I moved 400 miles away from everyone and everything I had ever known. I started over in the city of Derby, Bourbon, and Cardinals. I learned to love hot browns and added &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; to my daily vernacular. I visited home, and I counted down the days until I could make the 6 1/2 hour trek back to my new &#8220;home.&#8221; On one occasion, the first night of my first Christmas break, I even broke down crying to my parents about how much I hated being at home and I hated everyone there. <b>I truly believed that there was nothing in Hadley, Pennsylvania for me &#8211; and that I would never want to come back.</b></i><br /><i><b><br /></b></i><i>I didn&#8217;t come back after that, not for an entire semester in any case. During those four months, a funny thing started to happen. Some may call it growing up, others the idea that &#8220;absence makes the heart grow fonder.&#8221; Others yet may argue that I just finally opened up my eyes&#8230;</i><br /><i><br /></i>I come home to a small town, that is waiting for me with open arms. A town full of pieces of myself. A little bit in each and every one of its residents &#8211; some of the greatest storytellers, savviest financial advisors, and wisest life coaches anyone could ever ask for. A place where the muppears still come every summer, and we still curse them until they leave. (Some things just might never change.) A one building school where my name is immortalized on various plaques, and where I have memories from 13 years of my life. I hail from the Snow Belt, where we actually <span style="text-decoration:underline;">know how to drive in snow</span>, and recognize the importance of chains, snow plows, and studded tires.</p>
<p>I come home to a traditional little town. Where there is still a defining line, although these days it seems to be growing a little less distinct. I attend sporting events where, while we still can&#8217;t seem to chalk up a winning record, the home side is always packed. Where the other teams stopped yelling about tractors, trucks, and cows, because we just embrace it and yell back.</p>
<p>I come home to a town that shaped me into the farm girl that I am, the one I didn&#8217;t quite realize I was until I moved to the city. A town where <b>redneck</b> is a badge of pride, one that I fully accept now-a-days. The place I learned how to shoot a gun, ride a horse, birth a calf, pull back an arrow, spot a deer in a field while I&#8217;m driving. Where the air is clear and you can see the stars, and not just outside the city limits either.</p>
<p>I grew up in a town where no one ever really leaves, which makes it all the more special to come home to. A community that will stop traffic and stand in line for hours at the only funeral home in town, just to pay their last respects and stand beside our own. A place where news travels fast, and a helping hand travels even faster. A town that may only have one stoplight, but has &#8220;<i>more churches than people,&#8221;</i> and an American flag that waves each and every day without failure.</p>
<p>I grew up in a town that may not be on a map, but that I know well enough I could draw one by heart. I  grew up on back roads and truck beds, home cooked meals and homegrown beef. I grew up in a town where the gossip is always the same, and where deer season is a holiday. (No, not just the first day &#8211; the whole damn season.) I grew up giving directions using cornfields and old family properties that have been theirs for generations. I grew up in a home where my dad WAS 911. I grew up in a place that I couldn&#8217;t be prouder to call my hometown, with friends and family and loved ones and classmates and neighbors I wouldn&#8217;t choose differently even given the chance.</p>
<p><i>I grew up in an incredibly small town in Western Pennsylvania, where every reason I left is every reason I go back.</i></p>

		<p>Here in Louisville, things have been anything but calm in the recent days (read: weeks). Fall formal recruitment officially kicks off tonight, with the rushees attending their very first recruitment parties tomorrow afternoon. By next Wednesday, many will have found a lifelong home in the sorority of their choice and will embark on a journey that words could never begin to describe. To my sisters, Panhellenic sisters, and all the girls searching for their place in Greek life &#8211; my best wishes are with you. It&#8217;s a scary process, on both ends, but is more than worth the stress and hard work that we all put in. Then, after an all too short weekend of new friends and relaxation, school starts up again on Monday. If you listen closely you can hear the collective groan of almost 16,000 undergraduate students at the thought of this. Don&#8217;t worry guys, channel HSM, &#8220;We&#8217;re alllllll in this togetherrrr.&#8221; Well, on top of those things that are crazy enough on their own&#8230; There&#8217;s a threat of a &#8220;Purge&#8221; based off the movie series that is set to happen here in Louisville tonight. I know I&#8217;ll probably look back on this and feel silly for being so worried, but &#8211; rather safe than sorry, right? </p>
<p>So, the buzz about &#8220;Louisville Purge&#8221; got me thinking. What if (God forbid) something actually did happen? Would I regret the way I&#8217;ve spent my twenty years so far? I&#8217;ve always been a cautious person, overly-analytical and less than spontaneous. I always say that I&#8217;d rather have a life of &#8220;oh well&#8217;s&#8221; than of &#8220;what if&#8217;s&#8221;, but let&#8217;s be honest. I&#8217;m a &#8220;what-if-er&#8221;. I say no to things that could potentially be really good for me, or bad but with a hell of a story, because I&#8217;m afraid. It&#8217;s been one roller coaster of a year since this time last year, and I&#8217;ve experienced some of my very highest highs and absolutely lowest lows. I lost myself for a while, thought I found myself, and then very recently lost sight of who I was once again. After some soul searching and really good, ugly, Kim K-esque crying, I woke up yesterday with a renewed outlook. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always believed that new school years are a better time than new calendar years for resolutions and starting over, I even wrote about it at this time last year. This year is going to be no different. I recently stumbled across a pretty neat book written by Maria Dahvana Headley, entitled &#8220;The Year of Yes.&#8221; The long and short of the book is that, since she is tired of being single, she spends a year saying yes to every man who asks her out on a date. And, you guessed it, it got me thinking. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for a &#8220;Year of Yes&#8221; of my own. But, not quite in the same way that Headley tackled hers. For me, it&#8217;s going to be about being more spontaneous, more open to new experiences and people, more <strong>living.</strong> This is my last full year as a college undergraduate, and I plan to make the most of it. I have the rest of my life for spending Saturday nights watching Netflix, I&#8217;ll be able to sleep when I&#8217;m dead. I want to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to living each and every day that I&#8217;m given. I want to be able to look back on this year next August, and know I truly lived the depth and width of this year.. Not just the length. </p>
<p>I might fall flat on my face, or I might reach new heights that I can&#8217;t even imagine sitting here trying to type with acrylic, recruitment-ready nails. All I know is that it&#8217;s time to leave the past in the past. If things are meant to work out, they will. But until the rest of my life plays out, I&#8217;m going to be willing try everything at least once (within reason of course). I don&#8217;t have time, or the energy quite frankly, to rehash failed relationships, faded friendships, or ultimately &#8211; &#8220;<i>what-if&#8217;s.&#8221; </i>It&#8217;s time for &#8220;<em>oh well&#8217;s</em>&#8220;, and if I&#8217;m lucky maybe even some &#8220;<em>That turned out beautifully&#8217;s</em>&#8220;. </p>
<p>And, as always, you know where to find me to keep up with me and my crazy adventures. I challenge you to consider a &#8220;Year of Yes&#8221; of your own, in your own way. After all, like I asked myself&#8230;  </p>
<p>What do you have to lose?</p>
<p><a href="https://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/f447b9665f8869cbe62aea0faa73f4f1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-221 aligncenter" src="http://dallasknierman.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/f447b9665f8869cbe62aea0faa73f4f1.jpg?w=239&#038;h=352" alt="f447b9665f8869cbe62aea0faa73f4f1" width="239" height="352" /></a></p>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:center;"><em>&#8220;Sure I was scared of heights and roller coasters and fish. But I was also scared of trying. I was tired of making efforts to redeem what felt like a lost life and I didn’t know what more to do…Skydiving doesn’t define a person, sure, but the will to get up and skydive does…I never knew what I was capable of until I pushed myself to limits otherwise unknown.&#8221;</em></div>

		<p>[To bring you up to speed, I've barely had time to think and sleep let alone sit down and be alone with my thoughts for a few minutes. I started a new job with Oakley a few weeks ago and it's been absolutely wonderful. I work with the most.. I think diverse might be a good word here, group of people. At times it has tested my patience and will, but overall it has definitely helped me to see things from a new perspective (which I am always striving for). Formal fall recruitment starts on Saturday - aka a week from today I will have 50 new sisters! Despite all the complaining and whining I do about recruitment, I secretly live for it. More on that at a later date though. Moving on.]</p>
<p>We all know my sincere love for country music, and the way I tend to relate it back to my life every chance I get. Well, I drifted off into dreamland to &#8220;Beer With Jesus&#8221; by Thomas Rhett the other night, and ended up having a dream about my own beer with Jesus. I haven&#8217;t been able to put the thought out of my mind since. </p>
<p>Before I had heard that song for the first time, I never would have given it a second thought meeting up with Jesus anywhere but in Heaven. As a christian, it seems kind of silly to me in hindsight since we are taught that he is always with us. Imagine it&#8230; Running into Him walking down the street, at the movies, under the neon lights of your favorite bar. What would you do? What would you say? How would you react, how would you spend the time you had to be with him? </p>
<p>I feel like first and foremost, I would have to be typical and ask him about the people I love who he gets to hang out with all the time. Tell him to give them my best, and just remind them there&#8217;s not a day that they&#8217;re not on my mind. Just knowing that they&#8217;re doing okay, to me, would be the best way to break the ice. I probably would be too afraid to start out with anything else anyway. </p>
<p>Continuing the typicality, I think I might ask him what heaven is like. is it different for everyone? Is it really actually streets paved of gold? Do the movies get it right with the clouds, and pearly gates, and St. Peter? We&#8217;d probably get a good laugh over what I imagine hell to be like, I bet he&#8217;d think I had a pretty good sense of humor. (I imagine hell to be a DMV full of telemarketers chomping on bubble gum, where the laundry is never-ending and the only music is &#8220;Best of Elevator/Hold Music&#8221;).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked before about my feelings about unanswered prayers, and I would thank him up and down for them. There are a few things that I still don&#8217;t understand and I probably would ask him about, but for the most part I&#8217;d have to admit that he knew what he was doing all along &#8211; no matter how hard I tried to fight it.  </p>
<p>On that note. In my heart of hearts, I know that above all, I owe him an apology. But, probably not the apology that you&#8217;re thinking. (I know he has already died for and forgiven me of my sins). So no, not what you&#8217;re thinking. I owe Jesus an apology for selling him short, and not trusting in his plan for my life. Lately, there&#8217;s only been one set of footprints in the sand, and I know for certain that the saying about when this happens he is carrying you is more than true. Being the Type-A control freak that I am though, sometimes it is hard for me to just truly let go and acknowledge that there is a bigger picture. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious what poison he would pick, what his quarter in the jukebox would play, whether he&#8217;s a good dancer. I like to imagine that he is light on his feet and would have impeccable taste in music, obviously singing along with me to all of my favorite melodies. He would be full of stories like I wouldn&#8217;t believe, advice and insight that I&#8217;ve been too stubborn to listen for all these years, and a hope for the future because of what is waiting for when this life is over. </p>
<p>Maybe one day I&#8217;ll have the chance. But I think Thomas Rhett was right&#8230; &#8220;I&#8217;d tell everyone but no one would believe it.&#8221; But, it <em>would</em> be pretty cool to have a beer with Jesus. (Next year. When I&#8217;m 21). </p>
