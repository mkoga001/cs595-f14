			<p>A leadoff home run from the Giants Gregor Blanco gave San Francisco an early 1-0 lead in the first inning. After Kemp drops a fly ball in right field in the 3rd inning, the Giants capitalize on it by scoring on a safety squeeze, it is now 2-0. In the 5th inning Carl Crawford promptly hits a solo home run to make the score 2-1. In that same inning, Dee Gordon hits a SAC fly to left field, scoring Juan Uribe and tying the game at 2. There wasn&#8217;t anymore scoring for the next 7 innings.</p>
<p>Dan Haren threw spectacular only allowing 1 hit on 1 ER in 7 IP. After he finished off the Giants in the 7th, we got word that the Dodgers vested Dan Haren&#8217;s option to play in 2015, offering him $10 million. He said he might not be coming back, but anyone would be crazy to turn to that kind of money for one year. The Dodgers used a total of 8 pitchers, which means 7 came in relief for the Dodgers on the crazy Monday night matchup against the rival San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p>Now on to the 13th inning we go, which was a complete disaster. Correia came in hoping to keep the score as it was, he did not. Kevin Correia gave up 3 hits on 3 ER in the 1 inning he pitched. The Dodgers lost the game 5-2 in 13 innings.</p>
<p>Not necessarily getting players on base was the problem, getting hits and getting runners across home plate was the main concern. The Giants bullpen did not allow a hit or a run in the 6 innings that they pitched tonight. Puig, Ellis, and Barney were all hit by pitches. None of them came across to score. The Dodgers defense did not have their best game, having 3 errors on the long night, which one of the errors forced a run across.</p>
<p>The game lasted 4 hours and 16 minutes. Dodger Stadium was sold out on a gorgeous Monday night for baseball. It was a perfect setting for baseball against the division rival, but not the best outcome.</p>
<p>Mattingly could be one to blame for the loss, but 4 hits and 2 runs in 13 runs just isn&#8217;t going to cut it. If the Dodgers continue their hitting woes these last 5 games of the season, let alone this series, they can just hand over the NL West title to the Giants.</p>
<p>But I really don&#8217;t think throwing Correia was the greatest idea Donnie has ever had. I personally would&#8217;ve gone with Yimi Garcia before I went with Correria. Brandon League came in and faced a few lefties late in the game. Meanwhile you have a very strong lefty in Paco Rodriguez in the bullpen. What are you saving him for!? This is the last week of baseball, you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>
<p>Dodgers player of the game: Dan Haren 7 IP, 1 H, 2 R, 1 ER, 7 SO 4.03 ERA.<br />
Right off the bat I had a bad feeling after Haren gave up the leadoff home run to Blanco. Haren was literally shutting out the Giants the 6 2/3 innings he went after the home run. Haren was very solid striking out 7 Giants in 7 innings. Unfortunately he was forced with a no decision.</p>
<p>The Dodgers will take on the rival Giants in game 2 of the 3 game series tonight at 7:10 PT at Dodger Stadium. They look to knot up the series and go into game 3 with confidence having Kershaw on the mound on Wednesday. The Dodgers lead in the NL West is now down to 3.5 games.</p>
<p>Pitching Matchup:</p>
<p>Madison Bumgarner 18-9, 2.91 ERA vs. Zack Greinke 15-8, 2.76 ERA</p>
<p>Go Dodgers!</p>

			<p>The offense was very productive yet again just like they were on Saturday. The bullpen was the exact opposite of productive on Saturday. The Dodgers had a strong 7-2 lead heading to the bottom of the seventh, which was when all the wheels fell off. Howell came in to pitch in the 7th. Rizzo produced an RBI single to make it 7-3. After loading up the bases, Howell serves up a 3-run home run, with the Dodgers now with a measly 1 run lead. Just when the Dodgers were hoping the 7th inning was the worst to come, Brian Wilson gives up a 2 run home run in the bottom of the 8th to lose the lead and the game.</p>
<p>Right out of the chute, the Dodgers scored 2 runs in the first inning on Sunday afternoon. Jamey Wright was the starter on Sunday afternoon due to injuries and lack of production from the pitching staff. Mattingly said before the game that Wright would be limited to 50 pitches. He ended up finishing with 46 pitches in just 2 innings. Allowed 3 H on 1 ER. Frias came in to relieve Wright of his duties, but it wasn&#8217;t pretty for Frias yet again. He goes 3 innings allowing 3 H on 3 ER. His ERA is way up to 6.75.</p>
<p>Matt Kemp homers in the 3rd inning to make it a 4-1 lead for LA, 2 run shot. Kemp delivers in the 5th inning as well singling to left field, scoring Yasiel Puig. With 2 runs in the 5th, the Cubs cut the Dodgers lead to only one run. Scott Van Slyke with and RBI in the 6th and Kemp with an RBI in the 7th to get the lead to 7-4! After a solid 1 1/3 innings from Perez, Paco takes over to complete the 7th inning with no harm done. Baez gave up a solo HR in the 8th.</p>
<p>Heading into this game, the Dodgers magic number to clinch the NL West was down to 5 games. Kenley Jansen came in the 9th inning looking to close out the game and he did just that. Despite allowing the first two hitters to get on base, he still got it done. The Dodgers magic number is now down to 4 games. If the Giants lose, the magic number will be down to 3 games.</p>
<p>Dodgers player of the game: Matt Kemp went 4-5 with 4 RBI&#8217;s and scoring a run. His batting average has been raised to .286. Kemp has been on fire lately just torching every pitcher.</p>
<p>A total of 8 runs came across the plate this afternoon coming off of 16 hits for the Dodgers. The Cubs with 8 hits on 5 runs. The Dodgers won the game 8-5. The Dodgers will fly back home to begin a huge 3 game series with the division rivals San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers also have a chance to win the NL West by taking just 2 of 3 from the Giants. Game will start at 7:10 PT.</p>
<p>Pitching Matchup</p>
<p>Jake Peavy 7-13, 3.82 ERA vs. Dan Haren 13-11, 4.14 ERA</p>
<p>Go Dodgers! Win the West!</p>

			<p>The windy city was in full effect yet again on Thursday afternoon. Winds were up to 20 MPH. The wind may have been blowing out to left field, but it didn&#8217;t affect (in a bad way) the two home runs in the first inning off the bats of Matt Kemp and A.J. Ellis. Kemp started off the scoring with a  3-run blast to deep left field, but he wasn&#8217;t the only one with a HR in the first inning. A.J. also hit a HR later that inning, a two run home run, to make the score 6-0.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast!&#8221;, said the Cubs, probably. They responded in the bottom of the first and put up 3 runs on the almighty Clayton Kershaw, yeah I was as surprised as you are. But those three runs were the only runs Chicago would scrap against Kershaw on the day. Kershaw threw 4 shutout innings after that. Despite being limited to only 5 innings, CK earned his 20th win of the season and remains the best pitcher in the League. His ERA dropped&#8230; .10 points. 1.80 ERA now for Clayton, which is also a ML best.</p>
<p>Rest of the game: The Dodgers scored 8 more runs.</p>
<p>The Dodgers hit a total of 4 home runs on this windy afternoon. A.J. Ellis has 2 of them, Kemp and Puig each with one HR.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s made me look good for so many years, it was nice to help him,&#8221; said A.J. Ellis after slamming a pair of HR&#8217;s to help pad the lead on Thursday.</p>
<p>Now on to the other side of the pitching matchup. Edwin Jackson had himself a tough day, or should I say tough inning. Jackson was unable to get out of the first inning and lasted 2/3 inning allowing 4 hits on 5 ER. This was Jackson&#8217;s first start since being put on the DL with a right lat strain on August 20th. His outing was Frias-like, except it took Mattingly 8 runs to figure out that the Dodgers needed to go to the bullpen in last Wednesday&#8217;s massacre with the Rox winning it 16-2. Jokish had 3.1 innings of relief allowing only 1 ER, while Dan Straily surrendered SIX ER in just 1.1 innings. The last 3.2 innings were well-handled by the rest of the Chicago bullpen.</p>
<p>Before the win, the Dodgers magic number to clinch a playoff spot was one. The win got them in. The Giants took a loss so now that means that the magic number to clinch the NL West is down to a measly 6 games! Oh how sweet it would be to clinch at the Chavez Ravine in front of all of your fans against the San Francisco Giants. I&#8217;m getting chills just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Dodgers player of the game: A.J. Ellis 2-4, 3 R, 4 RBI, 2 HR, 1 BB. The slugging cather, at least yesterday he was, smashed a pair of home runs, to help Kershaw earn his 20th win, and lead the Dodgers to win number 88 on the season.</p>
<p>Game 3 of the series is this morning at 10:05 AM at Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>Pitching Matchup:<br />
Roberto Hernandez 8-11, 4.06 ERA vs. Felix Doubront 4-5, 5.00 ERA</p>
<p>Go Dodgers!</p>

			<p>Zack Greinke got off to a rough start tonight allowing 2 ER right off the bat in the first inning. Valbuena with and RBI single and  Soler with and RBI groundout to get the Cubs going in the first . The score remained 2-0 until the 5th inning rolled around. An A.J. Ellis groundout RBI made it 2-1, but the Cubs score 2 more that inning which makes it 4-1.</p>
<p><em><strong>7th Inning</strong></em></p>
<p>The seventh inning was the turning point for the Dodgers. They scored 5 huge runs to take the lead 6-4 in the 7th. Juan Uribe reached on a fielding error by Logan Watkins, allowing Hanley to score. Ethier comes to the plate and promptly doubles  to left which scores Carl Crawford, Uribe to 3rd. The RED HOT Justin Turner grounds out to third but scores Juan Uribe to knot up the score at 4. Speedy Dee Gordon steps up and belts and double to left field, Ethier scores. Yasiel Puig singles to center which allows Dee to score from second base. The Dodger took the lead and never looked back.</p>
<p>Scoring once in the 8th and 9th inning made it 8-4 and the Dodgers closed it out for the win.</p>
<p>Now something we (we as in fans) have not got the chance to say this year, is &#8220;the bullpen was great tonight&#8221;. Hearing those 5 words are great! The bullpen was outstanding tonight, shutting out the Cubs the last 4 innings of the game. Greinke may have allowed 4 runs in 5 innings but there was not way the bullpen was going to hand this one over to Chicago.</p>
<p>Bullpen:<br />
4 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 6 SO</p>
<p>Despite having a surprisingly rough outing tonight and not earning a decision, Greinke&#8217;s ERA stands at 2.76 which is still very solid. Greinke&#8217;s line: 5 IP, 9 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 1 BB, 4 SO. Not really what we were all expecting out of Greinke, but it&#8217;s a hell of a lot better than the pitching performance we witnessed yesterday afternoon, which wasn&#8217;t a pretty sight at all. The bullpen is going to be a crucial part of this postseason run. You always have to count on the bullpen, nonetheless pitching in general, to come in and hold those games and not give up any runs. Trusting the bullpen has been a challenge this year. Kenley Jansen has done his thing, but he&#8217;s had his fair share of blown saves. I get sweaty palms every time someone comes in from the bullpen to hold or save the game, because you never know what is going to happen. We&#8217;ve seen it all this season, one day you see the 20 games over .500 Dodgers, some days you see the pre- 42-8 Dodgers, you just never know.</p>
<p>Dodgers player of the game: Brian Wilson (H, 22) 1 IP, 0 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 SO. Wilson has had a tough season. His ERA has sky-rocketed to 4.53, which is very high for a relief pitcher. It&#8217;s good to see the old Brian Wilson every once in a while, wish it was a lot more often though. He also earned his 22nd hold of the 2014 season.</p>
<p>With the 8-4 over the Cubbies, the Dodgers look forward to tomorrow as they play game 2 of the 4 game series at 11:20 AM PT. They gain a half game on the Giants with the win and a Giants day off and lead the NL West by 2.5 games.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pitching Matchup:</strong></em><br />
Clayton Kershaw 19-3, 1.70 ERA vs. Edwin Jackson 6-14, 6.09 ERA</p>
<p>Goodnight and go Dodgers!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yesterday&#8217;s game was not what Dodgers fans had in mind. Tuesday night the Dodgers were outscored 10-4. Yesterday they were pummeled 16-2, let&#8217;s just be fortunate it wasn&#8217;t 17-0. How ironic that would have been.</p>
<p>Due to September call-ups, the Dodgers have plenty of pitching in the bullpen. Carlos Frias made his second start for the Dodgers&#8230; and it wasn&#8217;t a good one. Giving up 8 ER and limited to only 2/3 of an inning. The bullpen did a very good job, well, everyone besides Correia, Correia gave up 3 ER while the rest of the bullpen only allowed 1 ER.</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks failed to beat the Giants yesterday which means the Dodgers NL West lead is now down to 2 games. The Dodgers start a 4 game series with the Chicago Cubs starting tonight and concluding Sunday afternoon. I&#8217;d be happy if the Dodgers took 3 out of from from the Cubs, but a 4 game sweep would be amazing. With the Giants having a day off today, they will start a 3 game series with the Padres in San Diego on Friday night.</p>
<p>The Dodgers two best pitchers, Greinke and Kershaw, take the mound back-to-back days. Dodgers fans always feel very confident when those two aces are up there on the mound. We can all guarantee that both of them will throw at least 7 innings and allow no more than two or three runs. Let&#8217;s just hope the offense can come show show some well deserved run support for Greinke and Kershaw.</p>

			<p>2 new farm teams have been added to the Dodgers Organization. AAA Albuquerque Isotopes are now with the Rockies, and the AA Chattanooga Lookouts are with the Twins.</p>
<p>Additions:<br />
AA- Tulsa Drillers<br />
AAA- Oklahoma City Redhawks</p>
<p>I think it is great that the Dodgers moved to another AAA team for one reason and one word only&#8230; ELEVATION!!</p>
<p>The players down south in ABQ were hitting dingers and above .300 and when they get to Los Angeles they realy can&#8217;t do much because the elevation is completely different. And it is also a really good reason that the Rockies wanted the Isotopes due to elevation so the transition from Triple-A to the majors is much of a change at all.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A little afternoon baseball as the Dodgers take on the Rockies in the series finale until they meet again in Los Angeles for the season finale on September 26th. With the Dodgers losing and the Giants winning last night, the Dodgers lead in the NL West is now down to 3 games. It&#8217;s tough for L.A. to rely on the DBacks to beat the Giants. We all know how terribly the DBacks, along with the Padres, and Rockies have struggled this season. These next few weeks are HUGE especially when the Dodgers come back home to face the Giants in a deciding 3 game series.</p>
<p>Carlos Frias took the mound in the high noon game in Denver today. Frias has been with the Dodgers organization since he was only 17 years old. He is now 24 years old and this is his first season with the major league club. His last outing, which was a start, came against the Nationals on September 3rd. His final line of the game was 6 IP, 3 H, 0 ER, 4 SO. Very solid outing and he was looking to have a similar outing this afternoon like the one in early September. It was a very very bad outing.</p>
<p><em><strong>1st Inning</strong></em></p>
<p>The Rockies came out with a huge explosion of hits and runs, to say the least.<br />
Frias allowed 10 hits and 6 runs in the first inning. He was limited to 38 pitches in the 2/3 innings he pitched. Scott Elbert came in to relieve Frias&#8230; Well, it wasn&#8217;t much of a relief. Morneau promptly singles to center which then scores two runs. Both of those runs get charged to Frias, which is 8 ER for Frias. The first inning couldn&#8217;t have been any worse. Well it could have been worse but let&#8217;s just be thankful it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The first two innings took about and hour to complete.</p>
<p>Now at this point in the game we are all feeling pretty damn shitty, right?</p>
<p>Down 8-0 in the 2nd inning there is no chance to overcome this deficit, right? Yep, you&#8217;re right.</p>
<p>What I got from the first inning: Coors Field&#8230; Pitchers. Worst. Nightmare.</p>
<p>One upside for the Dodgers is that they now have 8 innings to score 8 runs.</p>
<p>Two downsides:<br />
1) It is really hard to do.<br />
2) The bullpen has to be really good for 8 innings, which is also hard to do.</p>
<p>There were many downsides to this game but I&#8217;d rather not point every single one of them out, it&#8217;s just depressing and makes my angry. But the bullpen did just as bad a job as Carlos Frias did. Actually the bullpen wasn&#8217;t that bad at all, Correia had a very tough time getting people out.<br />
Correia: 3 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 5 ER, 1 BB, 1 HR<br />
Rest of bullpen: 4.1 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 1 ER</p>
<p>The Rockies ended up scoring 4 more runs in the next few innings to make it 12-0. At this point, all I can think about is &#8220;Please don&#8217;t score 17 runs, please don&#8217;t score 17 runs, PLEASE DO NOT SCORE 17 RUNS!!!!&#8221;. The Dodgers scored 17 runs Friday night in San Francisco and shutout the Giants. So yes, it would be very saddening and ironic to see that Rox put up 17 runs.</p>
<p>The Rockies scored 2 in the 6th and 1 in the 7th to make it 15-0, now only 2 runs away from the 17 mark. In the top half of the 8th inning Darwin Barney steps up to the plate and delivers a solo HR to put the Dodgers on the board for the first time this afternoon. The Rox got out with a bang and hit a solo shot in the bottom of the 8th, makes things 16-1. The Dodgers scampered for one run in the 9th and that was about it.</p>
<p>Dodgers player of the game: Darwin Barney 2-3, 1 RBI, 1 BB. Hit a solo HR in the 8th inning.</p>
<p>The Dodgers lose 16-2 and will now fly out to the windy city to begin a 4 game series with the Cubs tomorrow evening at 5:05.</p>
<p>Tomorrows pitching matchup: Zack Greinke 15-8, 2.64 ERA vs. Tsuyoshi Wada 4-3, 3.34 ERA</p>
