&ldquo;We went to Kineshma, that&rsquo;s in Ivanovo region, to visit his parents. I went as a heroine and I never expected someone to welcome me, a front-line girl, like that. We&rsquo;ve gone through so much, we&rsquo;ve saved lives, lifes of mothers, wives. And then&hellip; I heard accusations, I was bad-mouthed. Before that I&rsquo;ve only ever been &ldquo;dear sister&rdquo;&hellip; We had tea and my husband&rsquo;s mother took him aside and started crying: &ldquo;Who did you marry? A front-line girl&hellip; You have two younger sisters. Who&rsquo;s going to marry them now?&rdquo; When I think back to that moment I feel tears welling up. Imagine: I had a record, I loved it a lot. There was a song, it said: you have the right to wear the best shoes. That was about a front-line girl. I had it playing, and [his?] elder sister came up and broke it apart, saying: you have no rights. They destroyed all my photos from the war&hellip; We, front-line girls, went through so much during hte war&hellip; and then we had another war. Another terrible war. The men left us, they didn&rsquo;t cover our backs. Not like at the front.&rdquo; from С.Алексеевич &ldquo;У войны не женское лицо&rdquo;
In Soviet Union women participating in WWII were erased from history, remaining as the occasional anecdote of a female sniper or simply as medical staff or, at best, radio specialists. The word &ldquo;front-line girl&rdquo; (frontovichka) became a terrible insult, synonimous to &ldquo;whore&rdquo;. Hundreds thousand&nbsp;of girls who went to war to protect their homeland with their very lives, who came back injured or disabled, with medals for valor, had to hide it to protect themselves from public scorn.&nbsp;

This has always happened in history: Women do something important. Then they get shamed for it (so nobody will talk about it) and it gets erased from history.
And then certain men will say: &ldquo;Women suck, they&rsquo;ve never done anything important.&rdquo;
Look into history and learn that women have played a far greater role then douches (present and past) wanted you to know.

Hey Will (and Jack) I got you something.

So this is important. Let me tell you a story.
All the time I spend debating about women in combat, I&rsquo;ve picked up on a trend that disturbs me. Supporting or attacking, people are quick to draw on biology, psychology, law, but very rarely - almost never - do I hear about the history of women in combat, and the evidence their service lends to this debate.
Hundreds of thousands of women faced combat in WW2, and on both sides, and on all fronts, and it is a history that has been almost completely erased from contemporary awareness. I have been given arguments about how women can not psychologically handle combat. And about how women in mixed-gender combat units will automatically disrupt group cohesion - the brotherhood, if you will. Both of these assertions are erasure.
Women have not lived in a protective bubble untouched by combat for all of history. Women have been killed, wounded, and captured in combat, and tortured after. We are not living a world where these are hypothetical situations women have yet to prove they can handle. Unfortunately, they have, they can, in the future, they probably will, again and again. Soviet women served as partisans, snipers, tank drivers, fighter pilots, bombers. And more.
Both British and American women served in mixed-gender AA units. I could drag you through several examples of British women performing exemplarily despite being wounded, or seeing their comrades die. The Luftwaffe did not discriminate. Between the British and the Americans, it was determined that mixed gender units actually performed much better than all male units, because of teamwork. Because women are better and certain tasks, men are better at certain tasks, and at other tasks they are comparably efficient, and in a team, hopefully, in combat, you let the best do what they are best at. For the most part, they were proud to serve together.&nbsp;
German propaganda never commented on the British AA units, but they thoroughly smeared the Soviet fighting woman - flitenweiber. People often argue with me that women are a threat to group cohesion because men naturally give women preferential treatment. Which certainly explains why men are more likely to survive shipwrecks.&nbsp;And history shows us that Germans soldiers had no chivalrous compunction when it came to shooting captured Soviet women who were armed.
We&rsquo;re fed a history of war that almost exclusively features white male figures, most of whom fit into this destructive&nbsp;constructed&nbsp;myth of the soldier that is somehow both chivalrous and charmingly womanizing and who&rsquo;s sense of brotherhood is&nbsp;unshakably&nbsp;dependent on the band being all man. There is no history of woman at war, none. I hear a lot about how women have no upper body strength, I hear nothing about the Front-Line Female Comrade.

THE WORD FRONTOVICHKA BECAME A TERRIBLE INSULT - are you fucking kidding me? Fuck, that made me cry. At first when I started reading I thought I was reading alernate history fiction. I&rsquo;m ashamed to be ignorant about this, and full of rage and much worse bitter shame that this history is constantly repressed, suppressed, hidden. WHAT THE FUCK. D: D: D:

I didn&rsquo;t know that bit about the AA (Anti-Aircraft) units.

And even in this article I don&rsquo;t see a mention of the women of the Israeli Army, or women of the resistance if we&rsquo;re just sticking to WWII.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know about the Russian soldiers, only the fighter pilots, the night witches, and I&rsquo;ve spent years poking into the corners of history trying to find women who will serve as ammunition when men tell me women can&rsquo;t fight.&nbsp;
The best explanation I&rsquo;ve heard of what happened to women after WWII comes from &ldquo;A League of Their Own,&rdquo; the publicist&rsquo;s character: &ldquo;What is this&mdash;the war is over, Rosie, turn in your rivets?&rdquo;&nbsp; Women all over the world had to step into the same old ruts.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any mistake at all that Betty Friedan wrote her ground-breaking text for the second wave of feminism, THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE, just 10 years after WWII, after women had dined on a full plate of the same old, same old.
And shame on the men who never stood up for the women who worked and fought beside them, and saved their lives.

&ldquo;We went to Kineshma, that&rsquo;s in Ivanovo region, to visit his parents. I went as a heroine and I never expected someone to welcome me, a front-line girl, like that. We&rsquo;ve gone through so much, we&rsquo;ve saved lives, lifes of mothers, wives. And then&hellip; I heard accusations, I was bad-mouthed. Before that I&rsquo;ve only ever been &ldquo;dear sister&rdquo;&hellip; We had tea and my husband&rsquo;s mother took him aside and started crying: &ldquo;Who did you marry? A front-line girl&hellip; You have two younger sisters. Who&rsquo;s going to marry them now?&rdquo; When I think back to that moment I feel tears welling up. Imagine: I had a record, I loved it a lot. There was a song, it said: you have the right to wear the best shoes. That was about a front-line girl. I had it playing, and [his?] elder sister came up and broke it apart, saying: you have no rights. They destroyed all my photos from the war&hellip; We, front-line girls, went through so much during hte war&hellip; and then we had another war. Another terrible war. The men left us, they didn&rsquo;t cover our backs. Not like at the front.&rdquo; from С.Алексеевич &ldquo;У войны не женское лицо&rdquo;
In Soviet Union women participating in WWII were erased from history, remaining as the occasional anecdote of a female sniper or simply as medical staff or, at best, radio specialists. The word &ldquo;front-line girl&rdquo; (frontovichka) became a terrible insult, synonimous to &ldquo;whore&rdquo;. Hundreds thousand&nbsp;of girls who went to war to protect their homeland with their very lives, who came back injured or disabled, with medals for valor, had to hide it to protect themselves from public scorn.&nbsp;

This has always happened in history: Women do something important. Then they get shamed for it (so nobody will talk about it) and it gets erased from history.
And then certain men will say: &ldquo;Women suck, they&rsquo;ve never done anything important.&rdquo;
Look into history and learn that women have played a far greater role then douches (present and past) wanted you to know.

Hey Will (and Jack) I got you something.

So this is important. Let me tell you a story.
All the time I spend debating about women in combat, I&rsquo;ve picked up on a trend that disturbs me. Supporting or attacking, people are quick to draw on biology, psychology, law, but very rarely - almost never - do I hear about the history of women in combat, and the evidence their service lends to this debate.
Hundreds of thousands of women faced combat in WW2, and on both sides, and on all fronts, and it is a history that has been almost completely erased from contemporary awareness. I have been given arguments about how women can not psychologically handle combat. And about how women in mixed-gender combat units will automatically disrupt group cohesion - the brotherhood, if you will. Both of these assertions are erasure.
Women have not lived in a protective bubble untouched by combat for all of history. Women have been killed, wounded, and captured in combat, and tortured after. We are not living a world where these are hypothetical situations women have yet to prove they can handle. Unfortunately, they have, they can, in the future, they probably will, again and again. Soviet women served as partisans, snipers, tank drivers, fighter pilots, bombers. And more.
Both British and American women served in mixed-gender AA units. I could drag you through several examples of British women performing exemplarily despite being wounded, or seeing their comrades die. The Luftwaffe did not discriminate. Between the British and the Americans, it was determined that mixed gender units actually performed much better than all male units, because of teamwork. Because women are better and certain tasks, men are better at certain tasks, and at other tasks they are comparably efficient, and in a team, hopefully, in combat, you let the best do what they are best at. For the most part, they were proud to serve together.&nbsp;
German propaganda never commented on the British AA units, but they thoroughly smeared the Soviet fighting woman - flitenweiber. People often argue with me that women are a threat to group cohesion because men naturally give women preferential treatment. Which certainly explains why men are more likely to survive shipwrecks.&nbsp;And history shows us that Germans soldiers had no chivalrous compunction when it came to shooting captured Soviet women who were armed.
We&rsquo;re fed a history of war that almost exclusively features white male figures, most of whom fit into this destructive&nbsp;constructed&nbsp;myth of the soldier that is somehow both chivalrous and charmingly womanizing and who&rsquo;s sense of brotherhood is&nbsp;unshakably&nbsp;dependent on the band being all man. There is no history of woman at war, none. I hear a lot about how women have no upper body strength, I hear nothing about the Front-Line Female Comrade.

THE WORD FRONTOVICHKA BECAME A TERRIBLE INSULT - are you fucking kidding me? Fuck, that made me cry. At first when I started reading I thought I was reading alernate history fiction. I&rsquo;m ashamed to be ignorant about this, and full of rage and much worse bitter shame that this history is constantly repressed, suppressed, hidden. WHAT THE FUCK. D: D: D:

I didn&rsquo;t know that bit about the AA (Anti-Aircraft) units.

&ldquo;We went to Kineshma, that&rsquo;s in Ivanovo region, to visit his parents. I went as a heroine and I never expected someone to welcome me, a front-line girl, like that. We&rsquo;ve gone through so much, we&rsquo;ve saved lives, lifes of mothers, wives. And then&hellip; I heard accusations, I was bad-mouthed. Before that I&rsquo;ve only ever been &ldquo;dear sister&rdquo;&hellip; We had tea and my husband&rsquo;s mother took him aside and started crying: &ldquo;Who did you marry? A front-line girl&hellip; You have two younger sisters. Who&rsquo;s going to marry them now?&rdquo; When I think back to that moment I feel tears welling up. Imagine: I had a record, I loved it a lot. There was a song, it said: you have the right to wear the best shoes. That was about a front-line girl. I had it playing, and [his?] elder sister came up and broke it apart, saying: you have no rights. They destroyed all my photos from the war&hellip; We, front-line girls, went through so much during hte war&hellip; and then we had another war. Another terrible war. The men left us, they didn&rsquo;t cover our backs. Not like at the front.&rdquo; from С.Алексеевич &ldquo;У войны не женское лицо&rdquo;
In Soviet Union women participating in WWII were erased from history, remaining as the occasional anecdote of a female sniper or simply as medical staff or, at best, radio specialists. The word &ldquo;front-line girl&rdquo; (frontovichka) became a terrible insult, synonimous to &ldquo;whore&rdquo;. Hundreds thousand&nbsp;of girls who went to war to protect their homeland with their very lives, who came back injured or disabled, with medals for valor, had to hide it to protect themselves from public scorn.&nbsp;

This has always happened in history: Women do something important. Then they get shamed for it (so nobody will talk about it) and it gets erased from history.
And then certain men will say: &ldquo;Women suck, they&rsquo;ve never done anything important.&rdquo;
Look into history and learn that women have played a far greater role then douches (present and past) wanted you to know.

Hey Will (and Jack) I got you something.

So this is important. Let me tell you a story.
All the time I spend debating about women in combat, I&rsquo;ve picked up on a trend that disturbs me. Supporting or attacking, people are quick to draw on biology, psychology, law, but very rarely - almost never - do I hear about the history of women in combat, and the evidence their service lends to this debate.
Hundreds of thousands of women faced combat in WW2, and on both sides, and on all fronts, and it is a history that has been almost completely erased from contemporary awareness. I have been given arguments about how women can not psychologically handle combat. And about how women in mixed-gender combat units will automatically disrupt group cohesion - the brotherhood, if you will. Both of these assertions are erasure.
Women have not lived in a protective bubble untouched by combat for all of history. Women have been killed, wounded, and captured in combat, and tortured after. We are not living a world where these are hypothetical situations women have yet to prove they can handle. Unfortunately, they have, they can, in the future, they probably will, again and again. Soviet women served as partisans, snipers, tank drivers, fighter pilots, bombers. And more.
Both British and American women served in mixed-gender AA units. I could drag you through several examples of British women performing exemplarily despite being wounded, or seeing their comrades die. The Luftwaffe did not discriminate. Between the British and the Americans, it was determined that mixed gender units actually performed much better than all male units, because of teamwork. Because women are better and certain tasks, men are better at certain tasks, and at other tasks they are comparably efficient, and in a team, hopefully, in combat, you let the best do what they are best at. For the most part, they were proud to serve together.&nbsp;
German propaganda never commented on the British AA units, but they thoroughly smeared the Soviet fighting woman - flitenweiber. People often argue with me that women are a threat to group cohesion because men naturally give women preferential treatment. Which certainly explains why men are more likely to survive shipwrecks.&nbsp;And history shows us that Germans soldiers had no chivalrous compunction when it came to shooting captured Soviet women who were armed.
We&rsquo;re fed a history of war that almost exclusively features white male figures, most of whom fit into this destructive&nbsp;constructed&nbsp;myth of the soldier that is somehow both chivalrous and charmingly womanizing and who&rsquo;s sense of brotherhood is&nbsp;unshakably&nbsp;dependent on the band being all man. There is no history of woman at war, none. I hear a lot about how women have no upper body strength, I hear nothing about the Front-Line Female Comrade.

THE WORD FRONTOVICHKA BECAME A TERRIBLE INSULT - are you fucking kidding me? Fuck, that made me cry. At first when I started reading I thought I was reading alernate history fiction. I&rsquo;m ashamed to be ignorant about this, and full of rage and much worse bitter shame that this history is constantly repressed, suppressed, hidden. WHAT THE FUCK. D: D: D:

I didn&rsquo;t know that bit about the AA (Anti-Aircraft) units.

And even in this article I don&rsquo;t see a mention of the women of the Israeli Army, or women of the resistance if we&rsquo;re just sticking to WWII.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know about the Russian soldiers, only the fighter pilots, the night witches, and I&rsquo;ve spent years poking into the corners of history trying to find women who will serve as ammunition when men tell me women can&rsquo;t fight.&nbsp;
The best explanation I&rsquo;ve heard of what happened to women after WWII comes from &ldquo;A League of Their Own,&rdquo; the publicist&rsquo;s character: &ldquo;What is this&mdash;the war is over, Rosie, turn in your rivets?&rdquo;&nbsp; Women all over the world had to step into the same old ruts.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any mistake at all that Betty Friedan wrote her ground-breaking text for the second wave of feminism, THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE, just 10 years after WWII, after women had dined on a full plate of the same old, same old.

							<p>The depiction of female characters and their role in video games has been a hotly debated issue in the community as of late, brought on by controversial gender analysis documentaries and comments made by certain game developers that some took as evidence of a viewpoint that the medium has a clear problem with gender equality. While electronic entertainment is still perceived on a public level as a boys’ club, and has a long way to go in terms of truly reaching  a wider, more diverse audience, many seem to miss examples of the underrepresented that don&#8217;t inhabit the more clearly marketed AAA space.  The following are but a few that really exemplify the breadth and depth of the female protagonist in games.</p>
<h2><strong>//Kat from Gravity Rush</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://hardreset.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20121126_gravity_rush.jpg"><img alt="20121126_gravity_rush" class="size-medium wp-image-19363 alignleft" src="http://hardreset.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20121126_gravity_rush-300x85.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Kat represents the kind of understated characterization that other developers could learn a lot from.  The game places our hero in a bizarre, topsy-turvy town of Heksevile, which is the shattered remains of a former metropolis floating in a turbulent void after an unknown cataclysm. She awakens from a fall into the city with no memories of who she is, but quickly befriends a mysterious supernatural cat named Dusty which seems to grant her the ability to manipulate gravity. With these newfound powers, she sets off to discover who she is, what happened to the town, and where her abilities come from, helping people along the way.</p>
<p>The story ultimately treads familiar territory, but it is the characterization of Kat as she settles into a new place, meeting new people and growing accustomed to her new job as a resident &#8216;Shifter&#8217; that really sets her apart from her contemporaries. It is ultimately a coming-of-age story very reminiscent of Miyazaki films like Kiki&#8217;s Delivery Service, and the less fantastical daily routine of her life in Hekseville helps flesh out her personality as well as communicate her growing maturity.</p>
<p>In her role as an action hero, she shines even during her freshman encounters with the game&#8217;s antagonist force, the Nevi. Far too often in media women display strength through perseverance (usually through severe hardship), rarely are they ever depicted as being anything but reactive, leaning towards mere survival over any real ambitions. Kat, however, starts off mildly confused due to her lack of understanding as to how the world works, but quickly settles into her new life, approaching everything with a sense of excitement and curiosity. Her control over her environment allows her to never be put in a position of powerlessness, and the people look to her as a force of good in their community, someone capable of real positivity and change. She is never without control over her destiny and ultimately is able to triumph over challenges with a sense of confidence and self-worth.</p>
<h2><strong>//Shanoa from Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://hardreset.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/112081-full.jpeg"><img alt="112081-full" class="size-medium wp-image-19364 alignleft" src="http://hardreset.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/112081-full-300x90.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Castlevania has a tradition of pitting members of the famous monster slayer clan The Belmonts up against king vampire Dracula time and time again.  Order of Ecclesia decides to completely ditch the tradition, focusing on an organization formed to fill the gap the Belmont clan left.  The leader of the Order, Barlowe, elects main character Shanoa to be the vessel for the power meant to slay the vampire menace in case it ever returns, which angers her jealous associate Albus.  During her induction ceremony, Albus steals the glyphs needed and declares himself their rightful heir, and flees, leaving a hurt, and now emotionless/amnesiac Shanoa in his wake.  Under the guidance of Barlowe, she sets off after Albus hoping to restore her memories and emotions.</p>
<p>While the cliche of amnesiac or stoic hero isn&#8217;t exactly a new concept in video games, it is interesting to see these tropes used as a way to tell a character story about a young girl under the manipulation of a male dominated society who through her own brave actions comes to find herself as well as take control of her destiny.  She starts off an exemplar of the cold, uncaring robot trope, but as she interacts with other people on her quest, little cracks of her personality breakthrough, which is really touching to see.  By the end of the game, her (and by association the player) perception of both herself and the world they&#8217;re in is changed, and she comes out of it a better and more self-assured person.</p>
<h2><strong>//Heather Mason from Silent Hill 3</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://hardreset.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/silent-hill-3-wallpaper-heather-flashlight.jpg"><img alt="silent-hill-3-wallpaper-heather-flashlight" class="size-medium wp-image-19365 alignleft" src="http://hardreset.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/silent-hill-3-wallpaper-heather-flashlight-300x96.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Heather is another interesting deviation from franchise norms as the sole female protagonist but also very important to the lore of the titular town.  Drawn back to Silent Hill after an unfortunate event, she goes up against horrible monsters and bizarre individuals in search of answers as well as revenge.</p>
<p>In a genre known for putting females through gruesome situations with little to no hope of salvation, let alone control, Heather responds to nightmarish scenarios with not only a significant lack of fear but with courage in her convictions. Granted they give a little bit of narrative justification for her, at times, detached attitude towards her surroundings, but it is admirable all the same to see a heroine deal with frightful situations without constantly breaking down.</p>
<p>Not only does she power through to her goal, every character she meets either actively wants to dissuade her from continuing, or is completely inept to help her.  The entire game serves to flip horror conventions in which women are forced to flee from their inevitable demise, shrieking and crying until they eventually develop a modicum of courage through trauma to persevere over their assailants.  Heather bypasses all that by simply trudging through to her destination and accepting what is happening around her.</p>
<p>&#8212; &#8212;</p>
<p>Ultimately, these characters do not undo the history of the supplanting of interesting, relatable female heroes by the easier routes of overt sexualisation and diminishment, but looking at the way these particular games take earnest approaches to developing heroines with depth, strength and self-worth gives reason to be hopeful that progress is possible.</p>
