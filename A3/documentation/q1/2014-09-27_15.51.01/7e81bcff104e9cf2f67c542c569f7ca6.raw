Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), I was asked by my good friend Gina 
Savini to check in on a veteran who had been admitted to my hospital. 
Gina had escorted LT John Finn the prior day at the dedication of the 
WWII Memorial in DC. Gina was a Navy LCDR and a White House Social Aide.
 Gina had the privilege of escorting the LT, who was 95 at the time, and
 had fallen the previous evening in his hotel room. The opinion of a 
hospital ER was that some muscles were strained and LT Finn was fitted 
with a wheelchair in order to attend the ceremony. Gina was concerned 
that there was more involved than a muscle strain. LT Finn needed to 
return home to San Diego but Gina arranged for his admission to NMCSD on
 arrival.<br /> <br /> While Gina would have done this for anyone and 
certainly any veteran, LT Finn was no "regular" vet. LT Finn was the 
first man awarded the Medal of Honor in WWII. On Dec 7 1941, during the 
first attack by Japanese airplanes on the Naval Air Station, Kaneohe 
Bay, LT Finn "secured and manned a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on an
 instruction stand in a completely exposed section of the parking ramp, 
which was under heavy enemy machine gun strafing fire. Although 
painfully wounded many times, he continued to man this gun and to return
 the enemy's fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the 
enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his 
own personal safety. It was only by specific orders that he was 
persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention. Following 
first-aid treatment, although obviously suffering much pain and moving 
with great difficulty, he returned to the squadron area and actively 
supervised the rearming of returning planes."<br /> <br /> The LT was 
admitted to NMCSD. Turns out he had a hairline hip fracture. The day he 
arrived I met him in his room. I knocked, was given permission to enter 
and remember a sense of unworthiness in sharing space with this man who 
had been willing to sacrifice so much for his country. After introducing
 myself and informing the LT why I was there, LT Finn asked that I call 
him John. He introduced me to a friend of his in the room, another John,
 John Baca. John Baca was perhaps a 5-10 years older than I. John Finn 
went on to recount the events at the WWII Memorial dedication, how much 
it had meant to him to be there, and how important it was to remember 
fallen comrades. I asked about the events of Dec 7th in 1941 and he 
described them in vivid detail. He reported the anger he felt when he 
realized what was happening that morning. He saw good friends die, he 
saw pilots burned alive as they tried to get their planes off the 
ground. John said it wasn't bravery that day. He was just determined to 
protect the men he served with and those trying to launch their 
aircraft. He described relocating his trusty .50 caliber machine gun, 
firing, reloading, firing again. He described seeing the faces of Japanese pilots, 
several of whom he directly fired upon and hit. John was adamant. He did
 what anyone else in his position that day would have done.<br /> <br /> 
Then John Finn looked at me, pointed at John Baca, and said, "Now this guy 
here, he is one of the crazy, <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p18UMS5qp3Y/UMMms8EOxTI/AAAAAAAAAUM/a5gZQAN6DVE/s1600/136687015_john-p-baca---medal-of-honor-recipient-with-the-first-.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p18UMS5qp3Y/UMMms8EOxTI/AAAAAAAAAUM/a5gZQAN6DVE/s1600/136687015_john-p-baca---medal-of-honor-recipient-with-the-first-.jpg" /></a>hero types. He's a hand grenade guy." I 
asked for clarification. "Hand grenade guy?" John Finn said, "Yes CAPT, 
John here was in Vietnam. Go ahead John, show him." John Baca smiled and
 lifted his shirt. His belly and chest were a mass of scar tissue. John Finn 
continued, "John here was out one night on a patrol. VC rolled a hand 
grenade into his position. He took his helemt off, covered it, and laid 
on the helmet. Saved 8 guys. Cost him two years of surgery here at Naval Hospital 
back in 1970. Amazing he lived. You guys did a good job. Go ahead John, tell him the story."<br /> <br /> It was as 
John Finn had reported. John Baca recounted the events of that night in the Vietnam jungle back in 1970. Then Sp4c. Baca, of Company D, "was serving on a
 recoilless rifle team during a night ambush mission. A platoon from his
 company was sent to investigate the detonation of an automatic ambush 
device forward of his unit's main position and soon came under intense 
enemy fire from concealed positions along the trail. Hearing the heavy 
firing from the platoon position and realizing that his recoilless rifle
 team could assist the members of the besieged patrol, Sp4c. Baca led 
his team through the hail of enemy fire to a firing position within the 
patrol's defensive perimeter. As they prepared to engage the enemy, a 
fragmentation grenade was thrown into the midst of the patrol. Fully 
aware of the danger to his comrades, Sp4c. Baca unhesitatingly, and with
 complete disregard for his own safety, covered the grenade with his 
steel helmet and fell on it as the grenade exploded, thereby absorbing 
the lethal fragments and concussion with his body. His gallant action 
and total disregard for his personal well-being directly saved 8 men 
from certain serious injury or death."<br /> <br /> I have never felt so 
insignificant and awestruck in my life. I was sitting in a Naval 
hospital room with two Medal of Honor winners. And never had I felt so 
proud in my life. The pride welled from the knowledge that I served in 
the uniform that these heroes had worn years ago. I instantly felt 
unworthy but also felt the unmistakeable, unspoken, well earned pride 
that comes from wearing the uniform of the United States military.<br /> <br />
 I thank God for the blessing of that day. I pray that on this day that 
should live in infamy, that none of us ever forgets that we live in one 
of the few nations on earth that can produce men and women like this. I 
further pray that none of us ever forgets the incredible sacrifice made 
every day by incredible men and women who volunteer to wear that uniform
 in order to provide the blanket of freedom which we sleep under every 
night.</div>

<br /><span class="userContent"><span class="userContent"></span> </span><span class="userContent">Well, you can't tell from the LA Times and CDC comments. The CDC 
concludes this drop in "abortion rates might be influenced by a lack of 
availability of abort</span>ion providers, state
 laws, the general economy and access to health services including 
contraception." Sure doesn't seem that the CDC sees abortion like 
Hillary Clinton does...something that should be safe, legal and rare. No
 mention by the CDC that this drop in abortion rates might be due to 
women, and men, exercising their right to not engage in risky sexual 
behavior. Wait, is that a right? I may be confused. It's possible that 
only engaging in risky sexual behavior without the "punishment" of a 
baby is a right. <br /><div class="text_exposed_show">
 <br /> Nevertheless, the CDC resists connecting two 
other salient facts from its own reporting. The LA times simply chooses 
to distort them. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2006_2010_puf.htm#acasi_data_file%29">National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)</a>, sponsored 
by the CDC, the primary national source of data on unintended pregnancy 
in the United States, shows that from 2006&#8211;2010 NSFGs contraceptive use 
among women at risk for unintended pregnancy has decreased.
 During the same period the CDC reports that the the rate of teen 
pregnancies has dropped significantly. In fact, despite reports of less 
contraceptive use, the CDC reports that the rate of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db89.htm">teen pregnancy dropped 10% from 2009-2010</a>.</div>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://www.torchprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/truth-signs.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" class="mainImage" height="150" src="http://www.torchprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/truth-signs.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>

&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div class="text_exposed_show" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: left;">
The LA Times presentation of this data is stunning. The Times reports 
the drop in abortion rates then goes on to cite the statistics from 
Mississippi which had the lowest state abortion rate, at 4 per 1,000 
women of child-bearing age. The LA times states, "The state 
(Mississippi) also had only a couple of abortion providers and has the 
nation's highest teen birthrate." The LA times would, it seems, expect 
us to conclude that as a result of the lowest abortion rate in the 
country, teen pregnancy is raging in Mississippi. Amazingly, what the LA
 times deceptively fails to report is that the US has seen dramatic 
reductions in teen pregnancy over the last several years, and 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db89_tables.pdf">Mississippi is one of the CDC's top 16 states for reductions in teen pregnancy</a>!! Yes, Mississippi has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the 
nation, but this rate has dropped 21% over the last three years!! I'm 
sure this truth was just an oversight by the fair and balanced staff of 
the LA Times.<br /> <br /> Word to the disappointed purveyors and proponents
 of contraception and abortion, an objective view of CDC pregnancy data 
for the last decade suggests something amazing might be happening. 
Women, especially teenagers, are reducing the incidence of unwanted 
pregnancies, and it appears to be occurring in the face of a reduction 
of abortion services and the use of contraception. Could it be that 
increasing numbers of men and women, as a a result of education, 
spiritual enlightenment, the economy, legislation and other factors have
 seriously considered the choices they make regarding sexual activity? 
Wouldn't it be wonderful if increasing numbers of Americans, without the
 need for pills or a variety of contraceptive devices, abstained from 
sex until they were married, in a committed relationship or at least 
were in a position to financially support a child? <br /> <br /> <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l8ZBsSeLPxk/RspDVFTguSI/AAAAAAAAAVg/B0PWXMN0n7o/s1600/itsabout.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" class="mainImage" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_l8ZBsSeLPxk/RspDVFTguSI/AAAAAAAAAVg/B0PWXMN0n7o/s200/itsabout.jpg" width="200" /></a>If the left
 really cared about the health and welfare of women, they would be 
rejoicing, not distorting the hopeful message of these statistics. That 
is not the case, however. Abortion and  contraception are critical 
sacraments in a church whose survival rests on the degradation of 
traditional Western values. The family and marriage are cornerstones of a
 society whose foundation is built on belief in a Creator who has endowed us&nbsp;with unalienable rights.  When we as a people are stripped of
 the security, hope and courage which unavoidably accompanies our 
faithful adherence to Judeo-Christian tradition, when we accept that men
 are their own gods, and then in<a href="http://prolifeaction.org/pix/2011/fedplaza.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" class="mainImage" height="150" src="http://prolifeaction.org/pix/2011/fedplaza.jpg" width="200" /></a> our hours of need realize we are not 
gods and confront our frailty, and require external support, where will 
we turn? Having banished any notion of divine providence from the public
 square we will then be certified, card carrying parishioners in the 
Church of Liberalism. Then, in our time of distress, we will offer 
sacrifice and penance at the altar of the state. We will pray to the 
only god we know. We will implore the state shepherds to see us as 
respectable sheep worthy of their beneficence and generosity. <br /> <br /> The LA times and CDC are doing their part to make certain we are all properly conditioned for the state sheepfold.</div>

<strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Letter to a Young Mom Asking For Another View After Conversation with a Li<span style="font-size: medium;">beral Acquaintance Rob </span>(on the then Presidential candidacy of Barack Obama in 2008) Part IV of IV</b></span><em> </em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Summary</em></strong><br />
<br />
In
 the end Young Mom, this is a choice between support for individual 
liberty or increasing concentration of power in the state.&nbsp; John McCain 
supports a government that recognizes its limitations in securing life, 
liberty and pursuit of happiness for its people.&nbsp; Senator Obama believes
 that the government should be the source of that happiness.&nbsp; The 
liberal fascism of Senator Obama is smiley face fascism.&nbsp; Senator Obama 
sees the state as the principal force in the lives of American 
citizens.&nbsp; He would have the state control your healthcare, education, 
energy production, and finances.&nbsp; Senator McCain proposes a state that 
protects the right of an individual to life (certainly after they are 
born), ensures the security of the United States, and provides 
individuals the ability to make choices in their healthcare, finances, 
and education.&nbsp; Senator Obama has built his campaign on class warfare, 
promising wealth redistribution through tax increases (on the &#8220;rich) and
 tax credits (for the 40% of Americans not paying taxes) which cannot be
 supported based on his proposed spending.&nbsp; The last person to take an 
economy the likes which we are currently experiencing and employ the 
economic practices Senator Obama advocates was Herbert Hoover.&nbsp; Hoover&#8217;s
 policies quickly thrust America into the Great Depression.<br />
<br />
John
 McCain has served his nation nobly during war and peace.&nbsp; His military 
service is well documented.&nbsp; His legislative history is one of 
determination to form alliances and move legislation in a bipartisan 
manner.&nbsp; Honestly, this has been much to my chagrin.&nbsp; I have completely 
disagreed with him on some of these efforts&#8230;McCain-Feingold, 
McCain-Kennedy and McCain-Lieberman.&nbsp; His leadership on Iraq, however, 
has been impressive, and his commitment to reform spending in DC is 
critical at this time.&nbsp; Barack Obama has no serious accomplishments to 
speak of.&nbsp; He appears to have been at best a mediocre community 
organizer.&nbsp; He rose through the ranks of Chicago politics through the 
mentorship of a number of unsavory sponsors, including Wright, Pfleger, 
Ayers, Dohrn, Rezko, and Meeks.&nbsp; He was undistinguished as an Illinois 
legislator and remains so as a US Senator.&nbsp; Despite lofty claims, he has
 never demonstrated a willingness to reach across the aisle on anything 
of significance.&nbsp; Senator Obama votes with his party 97% of the time.&nbsp; 
In addition he has the distinction of being the most liberal Senator in 
the Senate.&nbsp; This is quite an accomplishment.&nbsp; Senator Obama is even 
left of Bernie Sanders, the only avowed socialist in the Senate.&nbsp; No 
doubt Senator Obama is capable of delivering soaring oratory and is a 
good debater, but what qualifies him for the Presidency Young Mom?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While
 there are enough differences in core philosophy for most Americans to 
arrive at a preference amongst these two candidates, there is another 
critical factor at play here.&nbsp; Character matters in choosing a 
President.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither McCain nor Obama is a perfect man.&nbsp; However, there 
is a staggering lack of transparency on the part of the Obama 
candidacy.&nbsp; Senator Obama has weaved a tangled web of radical 
associations over the course of his life.&nbsp; How can it be that there is a
 twenty year gap in significant knowledge about the activities of 
Senator Obama from his time at Occidental to his time in the Illinois 
legislature?&nbsp; This man wants to be President.&nbsp; We have a right to know 
this history.<br />
<br />
Rob reports words and deeds do matter.&nbsp; Rob 
says, however, he has seen nor heard nothing from Senator Obama that 
&#8220;insinuates that his views on patriotism were informed by Ayers, or his 
views on race were informed by Jeremiah Wright, or his views on politics
 by ACORN.&#8221;&nbsp; Senator Obama has attempted to make his own race an issue 
numerous times in this campaign, not John McCain.&nbsp; Senator Obama has 
stated that "there's no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of 
Native Americans as well as other persons of color in this country, 
we've got some very sad and difficult things to account for," and he has
 described his grandmother as a &#8220;typical white person&#8221; regarding a 
comment she made which he felt was racist.&nbsp; This is in addition to 
spending twenty years in a BLT church, giving ACORN $800,000 and 
describing our military efforts in Afghanistan as &#8220;air raiding villages 
and killing innocent civilians.&#8221;&nbsp; That&#8217;s for starters.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not exactly 
sure what would need to be said to Rob to provide evidence that Senator 
Obama has some serious explaining to do regarding radical tendencies and
 character concerns.&nbsp; So what we do know is disturbing enough, and if 
there is nothing to hide, why will Senator Obama not fully detail and 
release records related to two decades of his life?&nbsp; More importantly, 
why has the media not done its duty and properly vetted Senator Obama?&nbsp; 
Added to character concerns is the thuggish conduct of the Obama 
campaign, including support of ACORN and questionable campaign financing
 practices.<br />
<br />
Rob reports that Senator Obama is 
&#8220;visionary&#8221;, &#8220;even tempered&#8221;, &#8220;charismatic&#8221; and has a &#8220;transformative 
will on domestic and global issues&#8221;.&nbsp; Where are the Obama 
accomplishments that support any of these assertions?&nbsp; Rob offers no 
support for such lofty descriptors.&nbsp; That said, it is somewhat 
disconcerting that the qualities noted by Rob have been shared by the 
great liberal fascist leaders of the past&#8230;Woodrow Wilson, Mussolini, 
Hitler, Stalin, Mao.&nbsp; All proposed state centered solutions which 
sacrificed individual liberty on the state altar, some literally, some 
figuratively.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is much to consider in this 
election, and the bias of mainstream media makes it essential that 
voters use all information sources available to them.&nbsp; Cruising the 
candidate&#8217;s websites, as Rob recommends, is informative.&nbsp; The thoughtful
 voter needs to do much more, however.&nbsp; Liberal views are endlessly 
streamed in the mainstream media on newsstands, in airports, and on 
major networks.&nbsp; If you want balance Young Mom,&nbsp; add Fox News to your 
regular cable lineup.&nbsp; Despite what liberal bloggers at Daily Kos and 
Huffington Post may say, Fox is balanced; it might appear relatively 
conservative to some when measured against the liberal skew from other 
media outlets.&nbsp; Consider visiting some of the sites referenced in this 
letter.&nbsp; My hope is that you have the opportunity to give your vote the 
consideration it deserves.&nbsp; Time is short, however, and in this election
 voters will make a momentous judgment in the course they wish America 
to take.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This election, Young Mom, is a contest 
between well defined ideologies, conservatism and socialism.&nbsp; Both 
candidates have made their positions clear.&nbsp; We all have a choice to 
make.&nbsp; We may elect to reject the tradition that has made this nation 
great, a tradition committed to the pursuit of individual liberty, free 
society, free markets and a constitutional republic which recognizes 
limits of the power of government.&nbsp; Some may choose a vision which views
 the state as the arbiter of all rights and societal well being.&nbsp; 
History is replete with examples of what leaders of states do when 
afforded this opportunity.&nbsp; When all power is handed to the state, 
although technically composed of individuals, the state takes on a life 
of its own.&nbsp; The state reflexively seeks greater extremes of 
control.&nbsp;Young Mom, the socialist tendencies of Barrack Obama will find 
no modulation in potentially the most liberal Congress this nation has 
ever known.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, socialism seeks the destruction of 
democracy.&nbsp; It may come in the form of a smiley face, offering great 
oratory, but it seeks an absolute monarchy of power.<br />
<br />
Senator
 Obama has framed his campaign as one that fights for legitimate aims, 
while the defenders of democracy and the republic are painted as 
repressive reactionaries.&nbsp; He has attempted to picture his campaign as 
one with the forces of progress, legitimacy and even peace, while trying
 to discredit and paralyze the citizens who are only trying to preserve 
our tradition and heritage.&nbsp; In Senator Obama we are offered a candidate
 with no executive accomplishments, no demonstrated leadership ability, a
 history of radical and anti-American relationships, a career built on 
old time, corrupt Chicago politics, a socialist vision for the United 
States and a worldview which minimizes or ignores the significant 
strategic challenges facing us today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Young Mom, 
as a conservative, I can tell you that John McCain was not my first 
choice for a Republican candidate.&nbsp; He is a good and honest man though.&nbsp;
 He has sacrificed much for his country.&nbsp; He understands the foundation 
this nation was built on and he advocates principled solutions that are 
in keeping with that foundation. &nbsp;John McCain is determined to make sure
 that our children continue to enjoy the same liberties and freedoms we 
have been blessed with in this greatest of nations.&nbsp; In the challenging 
times before us America needs a leader who understands the difficult 
choices a democracy must make to sustain its existence.&nbsp; Only a tiny 
minority of the human race has ever experienced democracy.&nbsp; This grand 
experiment in our nation has only existed for a little over two hundred 
years, and is hardly a historical footnote.&nbsp; My prayer is that 
conscientious voters will consider the internal and external threats to 
this great American experiment.&nbsp; From Thomas Paine, &#8220;What we obtain too 
cheap, we esteem too lightly.&#8221;<br />
<br />
As American citizens, we 
are the beneficiaries of a harvest reaped from the sacrifices of 
generations gone before us.&nbsp; Should this dream be wagered on the 
bankrupt political philosophy of a mediocre community organizer?&nbsp; Or 
should we entrust this dream to an American patriot whose life is built 
on service to his nation and a realization that the &#8220;cause of America 
is, in a great measure, the cause of all mankind?&#8221;<br />
<br />
I pray we choose wisely.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Letter to a Young Mom Asking For Another View After Conversation with a Li<span style="font-size: large;">beral Acquaintance Rob </span>(on the then Presidential candidacy of Barack Obama in 2008) Part III</b></span><br />
<br />
<span></span><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Energy and Healthcare</em></strong><br />
<br />
Young
 Mom, Rob did not review these issues in any detail.&nbsp; They are, however,
 crucial.&nbsp; The price of energy has enormous repercussions for each of us
 every day.&nbsp; It is not just what we pay at the pump.&nbsp; Fuel costs, like 
corporate tax rates, are part of businesses doing business and are 
passed down to us in increased cost for food, services and necessary 
items for daily living.&nbsp; Energy is also a national security issue.&nbsp; We 
send $800,000,000, 000 a year to oil producing nations, several of whom 
are sponsors of the Jihadist movement bent on our destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Senator
 McCain has outlined a realistic energy plan that supports all 
alternative fuel developments, but also realizes alternative energy is 
not an immediate answer to our problems.&nbsp; McCain supports programs which
 will make it possible to build nuclear reactors ASAP.&nbsp; Eighty percent 
(80%) of French electricity is supplied by nuclear reactors.&nbsp; In the US,
 20% of our energy is from nuclear.&nbsp; This is because environmentalists 
have carried the day and despite the record of safety in nuclear power, 
they have convinced many of the American people and legislators that 
nuclear is not safe.&nbsp; Similarly we have not built an oil refinery in 
this nation for twenty years and oil companies are unable to drill some 
of the lands they now have access to due to environmental regulation.&nbsp; 
We have not built a nuclear reactor in this country since 1996.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Senator
 McCain realizes that for the next 20 years at least, we will require 
oil to drive our economy.&nbsp; Should we attempt to become oil independent?&nbsp;
 Yes.&nbsp; Both candidates agree on this.&nbsp; Senator Obama says we can be &#8220;off
 oil&#8221; in ten years.&nbsp; This means no gas powered transportation or home 
heating in ten years, but is this possible?&nbsp; Denmark is perhaps the most
 advanced nation in pursuit of alternative energy.&nbsp; Denmark has invested
 in wind technology for twenty years.&nbsp; Despite enormous investment and 
the most vigorous wind industry on the planet, this small nation is only
 able to derive 20% of power from wind; and the wind power they have has
 been costly and it is very unreliable.&nbsp; Denmark has not kicked the oil 
habit.&nbsp; Based on population, consumes oil at half of the current level 
of US oil consumption.&nbsp; Denmark remains dependent on oil, the difference
 is they do not import it, they drill for it.<br />
<br />
Denmark 
aggressively drills for oil in the North Sea.&nbsp; They have drastically cut
 their oil imports by building an oil industry which exports more than 
it consumes.&nbsp; What are those of us out here seeing gas and food prices 
go up supposed to do Young Mom while President Obama attempts to force a
 green dream on us which has not been attainable in twenty years for an 
extremely small, committed European state?&nbsp; Senator Obama has said he 
believes gas prices should go up, not too fast, but that we should pay 
more for oil and gas.&nbsp; He has said this pain is necessary in order for 
us to become less dependent on oil.&nbsp; He believes we should be paying 
more for gas.&nbsp; In pursuit of his goal of weaning us from oil, Senator 
Obama has supported everything possible to make sure there is no chance 
the price of gas will drop.&nbsp; He has opposed any domestic oil drilling 
legislation that would result in more oil coming out of the ground and 
he wants to institute a windfall profit tax oil companies.&nbsp; The result 
of that will be the same as other corporate tax increases.&nbsp; Oil 
companies will pass the tax on to us and ultimately, as happened under 
Jimmy Carter when he instituted a similar tax in 1980, oil production 
will drop.&nbsp; In the meantime Senator Obama will levy taxes to support 
green energy sources.&nbsp; This is part of Senator Obama&#8217;s vision to develop
 an energy industry supported by the state.<br />
<br />
The problem 
is, Young Mom, the nation in the world most committed to this process 
has over twenty years only managed to generate twenty five percent total
 of its energy from non-carbon sources.&nbsp; If this much smaller nation of 5
 million people, totally committed to this process still needs oil, who 
in their right mind believes we, a nation of 300,000,000 will eliminate a
 need for oil in ten years?&nbsp; Yes, we can and should try, but we need a 
leader who recognizes the realities of energy and who will build the 
bridges required in a thoughtful energy independence plan.&nbsp; This means 
recognizing that we have tremendous untapped oil reserves and that 
irrational environmental concerns have severely limited our ability to 
pursue a variety of energy sources.&nbsp; We can safely drill.&nbsp; We can build a
 self reliant oil industry (as Denmark has done).&nbsp; We need nuclear power
 and fast tracking of plants, not hesitation and double talk from 
Senator Obama on what we will do with reactor fuel.&nbsp; France does this 
for goodness sake Young Mom!&nbsp; We need clean coal, but despite what Nancy
 Pelosi thinks, this is a carbon fuel.&nbsp; And yes, we need alternative 
sources, but it is socialist and tyrannical to presume that the state 
should punish citizens and the economy with unnecessary oil and gas 
costs in its pursuit of a utopian vision of energy which even the most 
determined European states have been unable to achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Exxon
 made 40 billion on sales of $404 billion dollars in 2007 Young Mom, 
roughly a 10% net profit on sales.&nbsp; They are lots of costs which go into
 running an oil business, something those warring on big oil rarely talk
 about.&nbsp; That said, 10% profit is not bad, though not as good as 
Microsoft.&nbsp; Exxon didn't hit the lottery though, the government did.&nbsp; 
For all the sales taxes, duties and income taxes collected, the 
government pulled in a $102 billion on Exxon's sales of $404 billion.&nbsp; 
Young Mom, nearly 25% of all of Exxon's sales (not profit, sales!) goes 
to some governmental entity!&nbsp; Increases or sustained elevations in the 
price of gas will have devastating effect during the economic tailspin 
many believe will result from Obama economic policies.&nbsp; As we pump gas 
we cannot afford during a possible Obama Presidency, paying $5 or more a
 gallon, we all must remember that the government puts $1.00 in its 
pockets, the oil company keeps $0.50.<br />
<br />
As a physician it 
is clear to me that the Obama health plan clearly puts us on the road to
 nationalized healthcare.&nbsp; Some may disagree with the approach, I just 
wish the Senator would honestly state his intention.&nbsp; He believes we 
need government control over the healthcare system.&nbsp; Many agree.&nbsp; The 
driver in this discussion is the oft repeated statement that 47,000,000 
are uninsured.&nbsp; First, this does not mean these people have no 
healthcare.&nbsp; In fact, everyone in this country can show up at the 
emergency room and get healthcare.&nbsp; When this group is analyzed one 
finds that a third are eligible for Medicaid but are not signed up, a 
third could possibly afford healthcare insurance but have made the 
decision not to purchase it and a third need real assistance in getting 
on an established&nbsp; plan.<br />
<br />
Senator McCain proposes giving 
individuals choice in choosing healthcare, and offers monetary 
assistance to do so.&nbsp; He proposes a tax credit of $5000 for families 
purchasing healthcare on their own.&nbsp; Senator Obama has been erroneously 
advertising that voters will lose health benefits and money under the 
McCain health plan.&nbsp; Senator Obama is portraying the McCain move to 
consumer driven health as workers getting a $5,000 tax credit, health 
insurance costing $12,000 per family, and the worker getting stuck with a
 $7,000 bill.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; Here&#8217;s how it would really work. Suppose a
 worker gets $50,000 in cash wages and $12,000 in health insurance. 
Right now, he pays federal income taxes on the wages but not the health 
insurance. Let&#8217;s assume, for reasons of simplicity, that the tax rate he
 is paying is a flat 25% on his wages. He therefore pays $12,500 in 
federal income taxes. His after-tax, after-health-care income is 
$37,500. Now, under the McCain plan, his employer keeps paying the 
premium, which is now counted as income to the worker. He therefore pays
 federal income taxes on $62,000, or $15,500.&nbsp; But he also gets a tax 
credit of $5,000 for health insurance, which means that, all in all, he 
owes $10,500 in federal taxes, or $2,000 less than he does today. His 
after-tax, after-health-care income is $39,500. If the worker decides to
 buy his insurance in the open market instead of through the employer, 
the result will be the same. His employer is indifferent to how he pays 
his worker as long as total costs are the same. So instead of paying 
premiums, the employer pays his worker $62,000 in cash wages and does 
not pay anything toward insurance. The worker again owes $15,500 in 
taxes on this compensation, and he also must buy health insurance 
costing $12,000. So, his pre-tax income is $62,000, he owes $12,000 in 
health insurance premiums, and he owes $10,500 in federal taxes (after 
claiming his credit). His after-tax, after-health-care income is the 
same: $39,500 ($62,000 &#8211; $12,000 &#8211; $10,500), or $2,000 more than today.<br />
<br />
This
 plan would be a break even or slight cost to wealthier taxpayers.&nbsp; 
McCain would also eliminate restrictions on purchase of healthcare 
insurance across state lines.&nbsp; Many states have enacted healthcare 
mandates for insurance policies which have driven the cost of insurance 
through the roof for all.&nbsp; Perhaps you don&#8217;t want an insurance plan that
 covers the cost of cosmetic plastic surgery or artificial reproductive 
technologies.&nbsp; You have the choice in the McCain system to purchase a 
plan which meets your needs.&nbsp; You keep the amount of money left over and
 there will be money left over for most Americans.<br />
<br />
Senator
 Obama proposes a National Health Insurance Exchange which will create a
 government mandated benefit for all.&nbsp; He reports that you can keep your
 current plan and doctor, but follows on with reporting that those 
employers who do not offer the plan proposed by the Exchange will be 
fined.&nbsp; He refuses to state what the fine, or &#8220;incentive&#8221; for employers 
to join the Insurance Exchange will be.&nbsp; He most recently refused to 
discuss this issue in the last debate with John McCain.<br />
<br />
Young
 Mom, as a healthcare provider I have great concern with Senator Obama&#8217;s
 healthcare plan.&nbsp; It will force individuals and employers into a health
 care benefit managed by the government.&nbsp; The results of such 
experiments in healthcare, socialized medicine adventures, are visible 
throughout Europe and in Canada.&nbsp; Costs have continued to rise and cost 
containment, at the expense of quality, becomes the only course of 
action for governments committed to offering a one size fits all 
solution for individual health care.&nbsp; The government approach presumes 
the government is best suited to determine&nbsp;&nbsp; what health benefit 
everyone needs.&nbsp; Senator Obama says that he simply wants all Americans 
to have the same benefit legislators have, the Federal Employees Health 
Benefit Program (FEHBP).&nbsp; We need to discuss the FEHBP.<br />
<br />
Young
 Mom, the FEHBP is not a described benefit, though that is how Senator 
Obama presents it.&nbsp; This year, 283 plans are available through the FEHBP
 at the national and local levels. The benefit packages change from year
 to year&#8212; sometimes dramatically&#8212;depending on prevailing market 
conditions, consumer demand, and insur&#173;ers' willingness to compete and 
offer different pack&#173;ages through the FEHBP.&nbsp; This wide range of 
personal choices and the intense competition among the various health 
plans are precisely what make the FEBHP both popular and successful. It 
is the closest thing that Americans&#8212;at least those Americans who work 
for the federal government&#8212;have to a functioning, consumer-driven 
national health insurance market.<br />
<br />
The Obama plan has 
nothing to do with such choice and plan competition.&nbsp; Despite Senator 
Obama's rhetoric of "choice and competition," his plan is a vehicle for 
new regula&#173;tions and federal power that would leave ordinary Americans 
with even less control of their health care dollars than they exercise 
today.&nbsp; As a parent and physician Young Mom, the Obama plan is bad 
medicine.<br />
<br />
Instead of using the massive power of the 
federal government to impose a top-down change on the health care 
system, Senator Obama and other poli&#173;cymakers would be wise to transfer 
direct control of health care dollars to individuals and families. 
Senator McCain&#8217;s plan recognizes that this would enable Americans to 
exercise real per&#173;sonal choice of health plans and benefits while making
 health plans and providers compete directly for consumers' dollars by 
providing value to patients.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>The War against Jihadism, National Security and Homeland Defense</em></strong><br />
<br />
Rob
 leaves on the table several other important topics which you as a Young
 Mom should consider carefully in selecting the next Commander in 
Chief.&nbsp; We are currently engaged in a war with Jihadists and radical 
Muslims around the world.&nbsp; Despite what Senator Obama says, we did not 
ask for this conflict.&nbsp; The game was clearly on in 1979 with the taking 
of the American Embassy in Iran, but has roots even earlier than that.&nbsp; 
Despite this, the United States has been the greatest provider of 
financial aid to developing Muslim nations worldwide.&nbsp; I would suggest 
this has not always been wise policy but US economic aid to Egypt, 
Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey dwarfs that 
supplied by any other nations.&nbsp; We have been the savior for millions of 
Muslims worldwide not only through economic aid but through military 
support.&nbsp; We have sacrificed our most precious treasure to protect 
Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan from control by tyrannical regimes bent not
 only on our destruction but the torture and destruction of their own 
people.<br />
<br />
Senator Obama would have you look upon the 
military as a needy special interest group sacrificed in meaningless 
imperial adventures.&nbsp; Talk to military members who have served in those 
arenas Young Mom.&nbsp; Military members are proud of the service we have 
performed worldwide to ensure the safety of our nation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In performing 
this duty we have also created safe space for people around the world to
 attempt the experiment which has been successful here.<br />
<br />
The
 war we are engaged in now concerned mom has multiple fronts.&nbsp; It is in 
Iraq, Afghanistan and may be elsewhere in the future.&nbsp; Senator McCain 
recognizes the vicious enemy before us and the global conflict we are 
engaged in.&nbsp; Senator Obama does not.&nbsp; He sees separate individual 
conflicts.&nbsp; Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq.&nbsp; Well Young Mom, 
you would never know it from the cricket sounds in newsrooms, but we are
 winning and very likely have won the war there.&nbsp; Camp Fallujah was 
closed this week.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t read it in the NY Times or hear about it 
on the nightly news.&nbsp; There is nothing left for Marines and Army members
 to do in Anbar province.&nbsp; We have begun bringing troops home.&nbsp; This is 
happening because John McCain supported General Petraeus&#8217; strategy of 
counterinsurgency and demanded the surge.&nbsp; McCain defied the Bush 
administration, criticized war planning and demanded a different 
approach.&nbsp; It has worked spectacularly.&nbsp; Senator Obama said the surge 
would not work and would make things worse.&nbsp; He demanded withdrawal on a
 timetable which would have given AQ in Iraq a light at the end of the 
tunnel.&nbsp; There are many who would argue about whether we should have 
gone.&nbsp; There were many good reasons; enough reasons in fact that the 
Senate authorized this conflict (77-23).&nbsp; Senator Obama reports he was 
against the war.&nbsp; Fact is, he was not in the Senate at the time.&nbsp; It is 
easy to be in the State Senate and say such things.&nbsp; Do you believe 
Senator Obama would have voted differently than Clinton, Kerry or his 
running mate Biden?&nbsp; The fact is, like it or not, we remain at war with 
Islamofascism and we are in Iraq.<br />
<br />
The approach advocated 
by John McCain took courage.&nbsp; He defied his party in being critical of 
the war effort.&nbsp; McCain knows we are engaged in a multi front war and 
that to lose the Iraq battle would have been a disaster for many.&nbsp; The 
Obama approach would have been a victory for Islamofascism.&nbsp; It has also
 been reported that on his recent world tour Senator Obama, while in 
Iraq, asked PM Maliki to <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/09152008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/obama_tried_to_stall_gis_iraq_withdrawal_129150.htm?page=0">delay US troop withdrawal</a>. Per the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Senator Obama reportedly told Maliki 
that when a new administration came on board, they should be the ones to
 coordinate such a withdrawal.&nbsp; If Senator Obama believes so firmly in 
withdrawal, shouldn&#8217;t he be celebrating the fact that it is safe to 
bring some troops home now?&nbsp; The cynic would say no, he wants to take 
credit for that himself if he is elected.&nbsp; The fact is that the only 
reason anyone will be coming home in an orderly fashion and the Iraqis 
have a chance at stability is that the Petraeus strategy has secured the
 country.&nbsp; Such conversation by Senator Obama also displays a despicable
 disregard for the safety of our troops.&nbsp; If it is safe to bring them 
home, do so.&nbsp; Maintaining deployed forces, even if not actively engaged 
in battle, is a hardship on military members and families which is 
endured as long as it is required.&nbsp; In addition, requesting that Maliki 
keep US forces in place until a possible Obama Presidency is realized 
puts military lives at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Young Mom, the world views
 of the two Presidential candidates men are polar opposites.&nbsp; Senator 
Obama sees the United States as needing to assume its place in the 
larger world community as another member.&nbsp; He sees the United States as a
 big part of the world&#8217;s problems.&nbsp; Senator McCain sees the US as a 
world leader who must work with other nations, maintain alliances, but 
retain our ability to function independently in our best interests.&nbsp; 
Senator McCain sees the United States as a big part of the solution to 
the world&#8217;s problems.&nbsp; Obama believes, much as Neville Chamberlain did 
in the 1930s, that our enemies are reasonable people who can be talked 
with, or at least bought off.&nbsp; While Senator Obama and the media would 
have us all believe the US has not spoken with rogue nations which 
concern us most, President Bush&#8217;s administration has held talks with 
Iran, North Korea and Venezuela.&nbsp; We have encouraged European allies to 
take the lead on Iranian negotiations.&nbsp; They asked for this 
responsibility.&nbsp; The President of the United States should never walk 
into such dens of snakes without clear pre-conditions and expectations.&nbsp;
 Senator Obama has stated clearly that he would meet &#8220;without 
preconditions&#8221; with top leaders in nations determined to destroy us and 
our allies.&nbsp; McCain has made clear he will meet with anyone when the 
time and conditions are right.<br />
<br />
Young Mom, the Senator 
Obama national security and worldview is naïve and&nbsp; dangerous.&nbsp; Leaders 
of the worst of nations and terrorist movements (Venezuela, Iran, Hamas,
 North Korea) have espoused their support for Senator Obama.&nbsp; Do you 
think that is because he will insist that they conform to accepted 
standards of behavior for modern governments?&nbsp; When Senator Obama says 
&#8220;Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet 
Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union 
posed a threat to us,&#8221; he reveals a staggering lack of understanding of 
the ideology of these nations&#8217; leaders.&nbsp; These rogue nations with 
emerging nuclear capability, have all demonstrated a commitment to 
supporting terrorism.&nbsp; They are unstable and irrational, unlike the 
USSR, and have the potential to lethally impact democratic nations&nbsp; 
crippled by political correctness with relatively open borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In
 his note to you Young Mom, Rob does not even mention national security 
or the war on Jihadism as an issue which he feels will impact his 
family&#8217;s future.&nbsp; Simply amazing in this day and age.&nbsp; This is the world
 view, however, of those wearing liberal eyeshades. Despite the 
continual escalation of a war against the West over the last thirty 
years, liberals refuse to recognize the enemy.&nbsp; Some of our allies do, 
however.&nbsp; This is from Geert Wilders, Chairman of the Party for Freedom 
in the Netherlands, speaking to America:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong><em>I
 come to America with a mission. All is not well in the old world. There
 is a tremendous danger looming, and it is very difficult to be 
optimistic. We might be in the final stages of the Islamization of 
Europe. This not only is a clear and present danger to the future of 
Europe itself, it is a threat to America and the sheer survival of the 
West. The danger I see looming is the scenario of America as the last 
man standing. The United States as the last bastion of Western 
civilization, facing an Islamic Europe. In a generation or two, the US 
will ask itself: who lost Europe? Patriots from around Europe risk their
 lives every day to prevent precisely this scenario form becoming a 
reality.</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Dear
 friends, liberty is the most precious of gifts. My generation never had
 to fight for this freedom, it was offered to us on a silver platter, by
 people who fought for it with their lives. All throughout Europe 
American cemeteries remind us of the young boys who never made it home, 
and whose memory we cherish. My generation does not own this freedom; we
 are merely its custodians. We can only hand over this hard won liberty 
to Europe&#8217;s children in the same state in which it was offered to us. We
 cannot strike a deal with mullahs and imams. Future generations would 
never forgive us. We cannot squander our liberties. We simply do not 
have the right to do so.</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>This
 is not the first time our civilization is under threat. We have seen 
dangers before. We have been betrayed by our elites before. They have 
sided with our enemies before. And yet, then, freedom prevailed. </em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>These
 are not times in which to take lessons from appeasement, capitulation, 
giving away, giving up or giving in. These are not times in which to 
draw lessons from Mr. Chamberlain. These are times calling us to draw 
lessons from Mr. Churchill and the words he spoke in 1942:</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>&#8220;Never
 give in, never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large 
or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. 
Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might 
of the enemy&#8221;. </em></strong><br />
<br />
As you weigh your vote Young
 Mom, you must give serious thought to considering who should assume the
 role of Commander in Chief.&nbsp; Joe Biden made some disturbing comments 
about what faces us in an Obama Presidency:<br />
<br />
<strong><em>"Mark
 my words," the Democratic vice presidential nominee warned at the 
second of his two Seattle fundraisers Sunday. "It will not be six months
 before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy. The 
world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old senator 
president of the United States of America. Remember I said it standing 
here if you don't remember anything else I said. Watch, we're gonna have
 an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this
 guy." </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong><br />
<strong><em> </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>"I
 can give you at least four or five scenarios from where it might 
originate," Biden said to Emerald City supporters, mentioning the Middle
 East and Russia as possibilities. "And he's gonna need help. And the 
kind of help he's gonna need is, he's gonna need you - not financially 
to help him - we're gonna need you to use your influence, your influence
 within the community, to stand with him. Because it's not gonna be 
apparent initially, it's not gonna be apparent that we're right."</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong><br />
<strong><em> </em></strong><br />
Joe
 Biden almost bluntly declares here that a President Obama will invite 
challenges from enemies abroad.&nbsp; If Obama power diplomacy is going to be
 so effective, why will this happen?&nbsp; Senator Obama tells us, &#8220;if 
America is willing to come to the table, the world will be more willing 
to rally behind American leadership to deal with challenges like 
terrorism, and Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs.&#8221;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know 
about you Young Mom, but Biden&#8217;s comments are shocking to me.&nbsp; The VP on
 the Dem ticket, who in debates said about Obama and his ability to be 
President, "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he 
is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job 
training", warns us that a President Obama will react to the coming 
crisis in a way that demoralizes the country and which shatters public 
confidence in Obama.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Young Mom, no one is 
suggesting this would happen under a President McCain.&nbsp; There will be no
 rush by our enemies to challenge a President McCain.&nbsp; Why, because he 
is committed to protecting our nation and our allies.&nbsp; Why would 
thoughtful voters ever consider casting a ballot for a Senator Obama 
when his VP, someone familiar with foreign affairs, predicts a calamity 
within the first six months of an Obama Presidency?&nbsp; Young Mom, I want 
to elect someone who will be equipped to prevent such an occurrence.&nbsp; 
When even Joe Biden tells you that disaster awaits the first six months 
of an&nbsp; Obama Presidency, we should listen.&nbsp; There's no way to deny the 
reality of the defeatism and retreat represented by a vote for Obama and
 which our enemies see in a President Obama.<br />
<br />
John McCain 
has led a thoroughly examined life which has been ruled by honor and 
what he has judged to be good sense.&nbsp; He is not a man who wavers, not a 
man who will ever compromise the security of this nation to any enemy. 
Rob and most liberals believe the forces committed to the destruction of
 Western civilization are an exaggerated figment of Republicans&#8217; 
imaginations.&nbsp; You will have to form your own opinions about this Young 
Mom, but there is no doubt that the next President will have to make 
vital national security decisions that will have enormous repercussions 
for future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong><em>The Stealth Candidate</em></strong><br />
<br />
As
 you consider your next Commander in Chief Young Mom, you should be 
aware of an important fact.&nbsp; Senator Obama, if he were a civilian 
applying for secret, or even top secret clearance, would be denied.&nbsp; 
Senator Obama could not work as a civilian at Lockheed or at the White 
House.&nbsp; I have been through the clearance drill and know others involved
 in this process at the White House.&nbsp; Senator Obama would be denied not 
because he has a funny name and not because of his color.<br />
<br />
The
 mainstream media has done this nation an enormous disservice in vetting
 Senator Obama.&nbsp; I would highly recommend reading Senator Obama&#8217;s books,
 <span>Dreams From My Father</span> and <span>Audacity of Hope</span>.&nbsp; 
They are fascinating reading and offer some interesting insights into 
Senator Obama&#8217;s thought process and his struggle for identity.&nbsp; Perhaps 
most importantly, this is the only detailed accounting we have of the 
Senator&#8217;s activities over a twenty year period (1979-1999).&nbsp; Senator 
McCain&#8217;s life is an open book.&nbsp; During his twenties McCain was being 
tortured in a POW camp, Senator Obama by his own account (Dreams) was 
attending school, socializing with radicals at Occidental and then 
Columbia, and doing drugs.&nbsp; Senator Obama has NEVER talked about why he 
went from Occidental to Columbia, what his relationship was with 
Pakistani students at Occidental, how same students influenced him to 
move to New York, why he took several extended trips to Pakistan while 
in school, what the details were of his decision to go to Chicago, did 
he meet Bill Ayers while at Columbia, how did a very average student got
 into Harvard Law first time around, and exactly how was all this paid 
for?<br />
<br />
Senator Obama has a laundry list of documents he has
 either refused to produce or actively obstructed distribution of.&nbsp; 
These include all transcripts from all colleges and law school, theses 
from all colleges and law school, birth certificate (not certificate of 
live birth...there are many stories from his Kenyan family that he was 
born in Kenya while his mom was there, not Hawaii), passports, college 
loan documents, selective service registration, Illinois state senate 
schedule and agendas, client list from his time at law firms in Chicago,
 and medical records.<br />
<br />
So, no secret clearance would be 
granted without releasing all these records.&nbsp; No secret clearance would 
be approved with a history illegal drug use.&nbsp;&nbsp; No clearance with an 
established record of consorting with known criminals and terrorists.&nbsp; 
Three strikes, and you don&#8217;t get three strikes when applying for secret 
clearance.&nbsp; This might not mean much to those who have not been involved
 in the military or national security work. &nbsp;To those who have spent 
time in these areas, the thought of a President who never served in the 
military (understood many future President&#8217;s will not), who will not 
produce his selective service registration (making one wonder if Senator
 Obama is registered) and who could not meet the requirements for 
clearance, is incomprehensible.<br />
<br />
Rob, attempts to dismiss 
Senator Obama&#8217;s friendship with William Ayers as attempting to paint 
Senator Obama unfairly with the radical brush.&nbsp; If one is to believe 
Rob, then Senator Obama is an absolute incompetent and imbecile.&nbsp; Rob is
 asking for the willful suspension of disbelief.&nbsp; He suggests that it is
 unreasonable to believe that two men share core values when Senator 
Obama took his first executive job from Ayers, served the Ayers project 
for six years, served with Ayers on other boards and decided to launch 
his first political campaign from the Ayers living room.<br />
<br />
Rob
 is correct that Bill Ayers is only one part of the patchwork of 
mentors, friends and associates that form the Obama cloak of 
radicalism.&nbsp; Jeremiah Wright, as the former pastor of Trinity United 
Church, a church Obama attended for twenty years, preached the gospel 
according to black liberation theology (BLT) from his pulpit.&nbsp; BLT, 
according to James Cone (a mentor for Wright), one of its founders, has 
written, &#8220;Black theology will accept only the love of God which 
participates in the destruction of the white enemy. What we need is the 
divine love as expressed in Black Power, which is the power of black 
people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their 
disposal. Unless God is participating in this holy activity, we must 
reject his love.&#8221;&nbsp; Rob is not telling the truth Young Mom when he says 
this was never preached from the pulpit.&nbsp; Pretty much all of the vile 
bile spewed by Jeremiah Wright was done from the pulpit, much like other
 Obama minister friends (Pfleger, Meeks).&nbsp; Rob must not think you have 
access to You Tube, but check out this one of many videos of infamous 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvMbeVQj6Lw">Wright performances.</a><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong>The word according to Rev. Wright:<strong><em><br /></em></strong><br />
<strong><em><br /></em></strong>
<strong><em>&nbsp;&#8220;The
 government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a 
three-strike law and then wants us to sing &#8216;God Bless America.&#8217; No, no, 
no, God damn America, that&#8217;s in the Bible for killing innocent people. 
God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn 
America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.&#8221; 
(2003)</em></strong><br />
<br />
Most of the available tape of 
Jeremiah Wright is from the pulpit.&nbsp; What is truly astounding is that 
Trinity has maintained its tax status as a non-profit organization.&nbsp; 
That should have been stripped away years ago.&nbsp; Rob says that Wright 
never preached hate from the pulpit.&nbsp; He says that it is inconceivable 
that Trinity could be a racist anti-American institution.&nbsp; In fact, 
looking at the tapes of Wright and the reaction of the crowd, it is not 
at all hard to imagine that what Rob denies is fact.&nbsp; Rob describes 
Wright as the person who brought Obama to Christ.&nbsp; Obama 
has written regarding his belief that the black churches would play a 
critical in developing a political power base.&nbsp; From <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/2075109/posts">Obama</a>::&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong><em>"Nowhere
 is the promise of organizing more apparent than in the traditional 
black churches. Possessing tremendous financial resources, membership 
and &#8212; most importantly &#8212; values and biblical traditions that call for 
empowerment and liberation, the black church is clearly a slumbering 
giant in the political and economic landscape of cities like Chicago. A 
fierce independence among black pastors and a preference for more 
traditional approaches to social involvement (supporting candidates for 
office, providing shelters for the homeless) have prevented the black 
church from bringing its full weight to bear on the political, social 
and economic arenas of the city."</em></strong><br />
<br />
Rob 
attempts to diminish any concerns you might reasonably have about 
Senator Obama and black liberation theology by stating that Obama has 
denounced Wright and that his close religious relationship with Wright 
might &#8220;understandably engender certain forgiveness that strangers would 
not indulge.&#8221;&nbsp; Rob rationalizes such acceptance based on his 
recollection of the neighborhood priest he knew growing up who, outside 
of church, shared racist sentiments and smelled of whiskey.&nbsp; Rob, 
however, did not come to this priest at twenty seven, listen to his 
sermons for twenty years, as an adult ask this man to bring him to 
Christ, preside at his wedding and baptize his daughters.&nbsp; Senator Obama
 has also made it clear that he sees the black church as vital in 
furthering his hopes of developing a political action base in black 
communities.&nbsp; So based on Senator Obama&#8217;s writings it is not absolutely 
clear at all that he found Christ.&nbsp; What he did clearly find was another
 means to further his quest to solidify a political power base. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There
 is great detail that can be found regarding other troubling Obama 
connections, including Rashid Khalidi, political fixer Antoin "Tony" 
Rezko, Nadhmi Auchi, Bernadine Dohrn, Rev. Meeks, Rev. Otis, Father 
Pfleger Louis Farrakhan, and Aiham Alsammarae.&nbsp; I would be happy to 
supply or refer you to places for more detail about these relationships 
Young mom.&nbsp; It appears to me that Senator Obama could make all these 
concerns about his past and personal relationships go away if he would 
answer questions and release documents.&nbsp; The problem is that main stream
 media will not ask these questions, Obama will not spend time with 
anyone who will publicly put these questions to him and he is unwilling 
to release the pertinent documents.<br />
<br />
Rob doesn&#8217;t mention 
any of the latter relationships but attempts to dismiss the Wright-Ayers
 connections as an unfortunate consequence of choosing work in public 
life.&nbsp; According to Rob, such nasty characters will happen along on an 
ambitious individual&#8217;s career path.&nbsp; Rob reports that John McCain has 
had associations with Roger Quinn and William Timmons.&nbsp; Lets assume what
 Rob says is true about these men, which I don&#8217;t necessarily believe is 
the case.&nbsp; There isn&#8217;t space to quibble over it.&nbsp; These are hired hands,
 not mentors that have over decades guided McCain&#8217;s personal, religious 
and professional development.&nbsp; Much like the priest Rob discussed, this 
is another effort to dismiss disturbing insights into the Obama 
character using laughable attempts at moral equivalence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Running a Campaign</em></strong><br />
<br />
Lastly
 Young Mom, you should be aware of the strategies being employed by the 
Obama campaign to attempt to secure this election.&nbsp; A principal weapon 
in the Democratic&nbsp; election effort is ACORN, the Association of 
Community Organizers for Reform Now. This group purports to be 
apolitical, committed to representing the interests of the 
underprivileged in a variety of underserved areas, mainly urban.&nbsp; A 
review of ACORN&#8217;s history demonstrates that they are anything but that.&nbsp;
 A complete primer on this band of thieves masquerading as community 
do-gooders can be found <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDZiMjkwMDczZWI5ODdjOWYxZTIzZGIyNzEyMjE0ODI">here</a>.&nbsp;
 With some diligence, you can find multiple reports from a variety of 
MSM sources, implicating ACORN in fraudulent voting activities in the 
upcoming election. In <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/08/cuyahoga_board_probes_voter_re.html">Cleveland</a>. In <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080914/NEWS03/809140383">Detroit</a>. In <a href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/ci_10489323">New Mexico</a>. In <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/24004424.html">Las Vegas</a>. And in <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=785773">Milwaukee </a>the &#8220;community organizers&#8221; are hard at work, and it ain&#8217;t at removing 
asbestos from rundown housing or tutoring in school basements.&nbsp; They are
 paying people to register to vote, sometimes with money, in other cases
 with cigarettes.&nbsp; They are encouraging individuals to register multiple
 times to vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
There are too numerous to report past
 reminders of ACORN activities out there, but this one from 2007 in 
Seattle is representative of numerous others:<br />
<br />
<em>The </em>Seattle Times <em>adds that the announcement of criminal charges came after the King County Canvassing Board <strong>revoked 1,762 allegedly fraudulent voter registrations submitted by ACORN employees.&nbsp; </strong>According to prosecutors, six ACORN workers <strong>&#8220;had
 admitted filling out registration forms with names they found in phone 
books last October. The canvassers filled out the forms while sitting 
around a table at the downtown Seattle Public Library.&#8221;</strong></em><br />
<br />
Senator
 Obama, is intimately linked to ACORN (has taught at ACORN leadership 
seminars, represented ACORN interests in motor voter registration).&nbsp; 
From Senator Obama meeting with ACORN leaders last November, &#8220;I've been 
fighting alongside ACORN on issues you care about my entire career. Even
 before I was an elected official, when I ran Project Vote voter 
registration drives in Illinois, ACORN was smack dab in the middle of 
it, and we appreciate your work.&#8221;&nbsp; ACORN is a supposedly non-partisan 
voter registration organization that has had many of its activists 
indicted and convicted of voter fraud violations. &nbsp;Senator Obama has 
been involved with ACORN throughout his career and in turn, ACORN&#8217;s 
political arm has endorsed him while its non-political arm is pledging 
to spend $35 million this year registering voters&#8212; quoting John Fund, 
&#8220;most will be real but many fictional.&#8221; The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review 
has details regarding the Senator&#8217;s willingness to provide less than 
transparent support for ACORN activities:<br />
<br />
<em>U.S.
 Sen. Barack Obama&#8217;s presidential campaign paid more than $800,000 to an
 offshoot of the liberal Association of Community Organizations for 
Reform Now for services the Democrat&#8217;s campaign says it mistakenly 
misrepresented in federal reports.</em><br />
<br />
<em>An 
Obama spokesman said Federal Election Commission reports would be 
amended to show Citizens Services Inc. &#8212; a subsidiary of ACORN &#8212; worked 
in &#8220;get-out-the-vote&#8221; projects, instead of activities such as polling, 
advance work and staging major events as stated in FEC finance reports 
filed during the primary.</em><br />
&nbsp; <br />
Rob mentions in his
 note that Senator McCain has ties to ACORN, and attempts to dismiss the
 group as a non-sequitur in campaign discussions.&nbsp; McCain did attend an 
immigration rally which ACORN co-sponsored.&nbsp; That is the extent of 
McCain&#8217;s association with ACORN.&nbsp; The group is perpetrating massive 
voter fraud across the country, is registering democrats mainly in 
cities, has had its offices raided by police in Las Vegas for suspicion 
of voter fraud, and has received $800,000 worth of support from the 
Obama campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The financing of the Obama campaign 
is equally troubling Young Mom.&nbsp; Senator Obama has received historical 
records of donations under $200.&nbsp; These donations now total greater than
 $220,000,000.&nbsp; Donations less than $200 are not routinely monitored by 
the FEC and this might be a tribute to the amazing democratization of 
politics in the internet age.&nbsp; These <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/timmerman/Obama_fundraising_illegal/2008/09/29/135718.html">Newsmax</a> and <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=13981">Spectator</a> pieces report on known multiple illegal Obama campaign donations.<br />
<br />
For
 example, a donor identified as &#8220;Pro, Doodad,&#8221; from &#8220;Nando, NY,&#8221; gave 
$19,500 in 786 separate donations, most for $25. &nbsp;For most of the 
donations, Mr. Doodad Pro listed his employer as &#8220;Loving&#8221; and his 
profession as &#8220;You.&#8221; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Doodad apparently has a &#8220;You&#8221; partner at the 
&#8220;Loving&#8221; named &#8220;Good Will&#8221;. Following FEC requests, the Obama campaign 
began refunding money to Doodad Pro in February 2008. In all, about 
$8,425 was charged back to a credit card. But that still left a net 
total of $11,165 as of Sept. 20, way over the individual limit of 
$4,600. Regarding Mr. Good Will, analysis of the 1.4 million individual 
contributions in the latest master file for the Obama campaign 
discovered 1,000 separate entries for Mr. Good Will, most of them for 
$25.&nbsp; In total, Mr. Good Will gave $17,375.&nbsp; Following this and 
subsequent FEC requests, campaign records show that 330 contributions 
from Mr. Good Will were credited back to a credit card. But the most 
recent report, filed on Sept. 20, showed a net cumulative balance of 
$8,950 &#8212; still well over the $4,600 limit.<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s presume 
Mr. Doodad&#8217;s and Will&#8217;s donations originated in the US.&nbsp; How about the 
possibility of illegal donations to Senator Obama from foreign 
nationals? This from the &#8220;<a href="http://wwwamericanthinker.com/2008/08/obamas_donor_contributions_sil.html">The American Thinker</a>&#8221;:<br />
<br />
<em> </em><br />
<em>Despite
 dropping the groundbreaking bombshell&nbsp; story of "Palestinian" brothers 
from the Rafah refugee camp in Gaza who donated $33,000 to Obama's 
campaign, no big media picked up the story. Jihadis donating to Obama 
from Gaza? Could there be a bigger story?&nbsp; Foreign donations are 
illegal, but this story was all&nbsp;that and so much more. The "Palestinian"
 brothers were proud and vocal of their "love" for Obama. Their&nbsp;vocal 
support on behalf of "Palestinians" spoke volumes to Obama's campaign.</em><br />
<em> </em><br />
<br />
There
 has been no mainstream press or media interest on these subjects.&nbsp; 
Honestly Young mom, would there be interest if John McCain got donations
 from Palestinian refugee camps?<br />
<br />
Obama returned the 
Palestinian dollars, but never reported it to the FEC; and as above, 
Camp Obama has been much slower to return other illegal donations. For 
the doubters, observations can be corroborated by going to the FEC 
website.&nbsp; All the campaign contribution data is there.&nbsp; You can troll 
through it just as the above sources have done.&nbsp; Other foreign 
contributors of small donations to the Obama campaign, with uncertain 
national status, come from France, Virgin Islands, Planegg, Vienna, 
Hague, Madrid, London, AE, IR, Geneva,Tokyo, Bangkok, Turin, Paris, 
Munich, Madrid, Roma, Zurich, Netherlands, Moscow, Ireland, Milan, 
Singapore, Bejing, Switzerland, Toronto, Vancouver, La Creche, Pak 
Chong, Dublin, Panama, Krabi, Berlin, Geneva, Buenos Aires, Prague, 
Nagoya, Budapest, Barcelona, Sweden, Taipei, Hong Kong, Rio de Janeiro, 
Sydney, Zurich, Ragusa, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Uganda, Mumbia, Nagoya, 
Tunis, Zacatecas, St, Croix, Mississauga, Laval, Nadi, Behchoko, Ragusa,
 DUBIA, Lima, Copenhagen, Quaama, Jeddah, Kabul, Cairo, Nassau and 
Luxembourg.<br />
<br />
How about those small donations democratizing 
the election? Unmonitored and in the internet age, well, maybe not the 
democratization we might have hoped for.&nbsp; This might all be a moot 
point.&nbsp; While not specifically commented on at this time by the Senator,
 would an Obama administration consider election reform that would 
include legalizing foreign contributions?&nbsp; This would conform to his 
worldview.&nbsp; If just these reported observations, very possibly the tip 
of the Obama iceberg, were attributed to John McCain, would it make it 
above the fold of the NYT&#8230;for days?&nbsp; Would McCain still be in the race 
Young Mom?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So where is the national outrage over the 
conduct of the Obama campaign?&nbsp; Is the actual activity itself OK, as 
well as the willingness of main stream media to look the other way and 
functionally serve as a cog in the Obama machine?&nbsp; There are clear 
disagreements that many of us have on critical political issues, but 
most conservatives couldn&#8217;t support a Republican campaign built on such 
tactics. &nbsp;Is it reasonable to assume that for most, at least in this 
country, political views are derived from core values that include 
courage, integrity, honesty and commitment?&nbsp; If so, why are some of us 
willing to tolerate, and others actively support, a campaign and 
adulating media that promote goon tactics as standard operating 
procedure in pursuit of the Presidency?&nbsp; If a fellow citizen fully 
accepts the Obama political solutions as best, fair enough, we can 
debate those points.&nbsp; May the best plan win.&nbsp; Where, however, is the 
anger from both sides of the aisle over the deceptive, deceitful, and 
thuggish conduct of the Obama campaign, with the traditional media as 
unindicted co-conspirators?&nbsp; I expect this observation will elicit 
protests from Liberal friends but the Republican playbook is simply 
different. &nbsp;&nbsp;John McCain is simply an honorable man who refuses to 
debase our political system this way.&nbsp; If he had Young mom, you would 
have heard about it.&nbsp; <br />

We
maintained a "Consulate" (or CIA base) in a hell hole known
as Benghazi with an original security force that included an armed 16 man security team.
The "Consulate" was attacked several times over the last six months,
most notoriously in June when a hole was blown in the wall of the
"Consulate" by an IED. During this same time period in Benghazi the Red Cross office was
attacked with an RPG round, a UN convoy was targeted with an IED, and an RPG attack
was launched on a British convoy escorting the British Ambassador. The&nbsp; Brits
closed their consulate and the Red Cross shuttered its doors. .</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
What was the US response to the violence in Benghazi? No one talked about it, apparently
the President never knew, and we reduced the security force protecting our
Consulate...despite the objections of the leader of the security team and
Ambassador Chris Stevens. Sure, this all makes sense. Got it.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://ts3.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4511133813833866&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=228&amp;h=149&amp;c=7&amp;rs=1" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://ts3.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4511133813833866&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=228&amp;h=149&amp;c=7&amp;rs=1" style="height: 149px;" /></a></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Fast forward to Sept, 11th when on a quiet night, the
Ambassador entertains a Turkish emissary, and sees him off at the gate of the
American Consulate...40 minutes before a multi-pronged attack is launched. All
appears quiet. There are no crowds. There are no protests. Forty minutes later
the silence is broken by gunfire and explosions. A coordinated assault unfolds which
will include staged assaults with RPGs and mortar rounds. The State Department
is immediately aware an attack is underway via emergency alerts sent to Tripoli
and the State Department Command Center in DC.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
This attack raged for nearly seven hours after the State
Department was notified it was underway. Several pleas for help and assistance
were made. Our only response was to send a State Department security team from
Tripoli that arrived 5 hours into the fight, after being delayed by Libyan
officials at the Benghazi airport! It remains absolutely unclear why in
extremis teams from EUROCOM, assets that might have been floating in the Med, a
nearby FAST team or armed drones were not employed to assist in defending
Americans and American territory now under attack.</div>

This attack was watched shortly after its inception in real
time via a drone ordered overhead. Despite what is clearly a planned assault,
and months of warning that the situation in Benghazi was unstable, the official
explanation offered by the WH and its minions, for almost two weeks, is the lie
that a video was responsible for Muslim outrage that triggered spontaneous
outbursts of violence. The President, two weeks after the attacks, at the UN
declared:</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://ts4.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.5059875975397559&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=193&amp;h=150&amp;c=7&amp;rs=1" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://ts4.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.5059875975397559&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=193&amp;h=150&amp;c=7&amp;rs=1" style="height: 150px;" /></a>"In every country, there are those who find different
religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for
themselves must ask how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for others.
That is what we saw play out the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting
video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world."</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
The Secretary of State<a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/joe-biden-to-father-of-former-navy-seal-killed-in-benghazi-did-your-son-always-have-balls-the-size-of-cue-balls/"> told the father of slain ex-SEAL Ty Woods</a>, who (with Glenn Doherty, also an ex-Navy SEAL) died attempting to defend
the US Consulate, painting AQ mortar men with a laser hoping for supporting
fire, "We will make sure that the person who made that film is arrested
and prosecuted.&#8221; Susan Rice, the UN Secretary, went on five Sunday shows the
weekend following the attack and repeated the same story blaming an unknown <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>video with 300 views as responsible for righteous
Muslim outrage that led to a spontaneous
attack on the Benghazi consulate.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Last week Gen. Petraeus, then CIA Director, testified that
in his estimation he knew within 24 hours that the Benghazi events were a
planned, terrorist assault. He reported that references to Al Qaeda
organizations and terrorist coordination of these attacks was removed from
"CIA talking points." Talking points! How about we all just decide to
tell the truth and forget about talking points. We had been attacked, a
consulate (US soil) in flames, destroyed, and four men dead, including our Ambassador.
And what do these families, and the American people have for consolation? We
all get a lying President, a lying Sec of State, a lying UN Ambassador, and a
lying Sec Def. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp; </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://media.townhall.com/Townhall/Car/a/GM120411CLR-PanettaC20120411045145.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="http://media.townhall.com/Townhall/Car/a/GM120411CLR-PanettaC20120411045145.jpg" border="0" class="decoded" src="http://media.townhall.com/Townhall/Car/a/GM120411CLR-PanettaC20120411045145.jpg" /></a>And when the lie becomes increasingly unsupportable, we are
treated to a Sec Def who educates us on the role of the military, &#8220;The basic
principle is that you don&#8217;t deploy forces into harm&#8217;s way without knowing
what&#8217;s going on, without having some real-time information about what&#8217;s taking
place.&#8221; Excuse me Mr. Sec Def,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>this is
exactly the mission of the special ops community&#8230;you know, the warriors you bloviating,
mendacious cowards in this administration always tell us you are committed to supporting!
This lying sack of crap should be tarred, feathered and thrown into the
Potomac. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The <a href="http://rhinoden.rangerup.com/a-tale-of-four-heroes/">depth of deception and treason</a> involved in Benghazi is staggering. This astonishing duplicity prompts
multiple questions.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Why did our consulate remain open in Benghazi remain open
given the security situation? Why did we reduce security in this unstable
environment? Were we reclaiming weapons loosed by the Libyan
"liberation" and sending them to Syrian rebels? Were we partnered
with Al Qaeda elements in Libya to secure and run these weapons? Were we
working with the Turks and Saudis on this project? Were we shipping these arms
to Syrian "rebels" who are Al Qaeda in Syria? Was Ambassador Stevens
the front man for a gun running operation? Was this the Mideast version of Fast
and Furious...on steroids?</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://ts1.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4629563233601652&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=177&amp;h=150&amp;c=7&amp;rs=1" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://ts1.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4629563233601652&amp;pid=1.7&amp;w=177&amp;h=150&amp;c=7&amp;rs=1" style="height: 150px;" /></a>Regarding the attack, when did the President find out about
this situation? Was it one hour after it began during his meetings scheduled
with Sec Def Panetta and Gen. Dempsey? Despite multiple calls for help why were
military asset options in the region not mobilized? Were theater commanders told
to stand down in mobilizing these assets? Why have we not heard from key
theater commanders who have either mysteriously retired or been removed from
command since September 11th? What does Gen. Ham AFRICOM Commander have to say?
Why was RADM Gauoette, Commander of the John Stennis Strike Group, on station in the Med on Sept 11th, relieved?
What does he have to say? Were these men willing to stand up and send support
to Benghazi in spite of orders from DC to stand down?</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
The last set of questions around Benghazi should focus on the fact that despite a horrific attack of a US "consulate", the "consulate" was never secured. CNN reporters, walking through the rubble three days after the event, found Ambassador Steven's diary! We were told endlessly by the President that after the attack he ordered forces to the scene to secure the consulate and personnel in Benghazi. I guess secure is a pretty relative term. We were also told that the FBI was being ordered to the scene of the violence. The FBI did not arrive in Benghazi until three weeks after the attack. Despite that copyboy for the Obama administration, <a href="http://theulstermanreport.com/2012/09/28/now-obama-administration-caught-lying-about-investigation-into-benghazi-attack/">Jay Carney</a> was informing us that an active investigation was ongoing 10 days after the attack. Investigators were not on the ground in Benghazi until October!&nbsp;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
So an American Ambassador is murdered, three other Americans killed and a "consulate" sacked, but US investigators don't show up for three weeks? Why is this? This is inexplicable. &nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<a href="http://www.debbieschlussel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jillkelleypetraeus.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56341" height="148" src="http://www.debbieschlussel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jillkelleypetraeus.jpg" title="jillkelleypetraeus" width="200" /></a>Now enter Paula Broadwell and perhaps more interestingly,
Jill Kelly. Broadwell apparently was Petraeus' paramour. Though we are told
that the FBI learned of this relationship only later this summer, and the President
only heard about it election eve, it is likely the General was involved with
Ms. Broadwell when she began writing his biography in Afghanistan. Many know
they had a relationship and it is likely so did the FBI and the WH. Why
nominate such a man for CIA Director then? That is unclear, but Jill Kelly, a
socialite who volunteered to lead social functions at home of CENTCOM, MacDill
AFB in Tampa, began receiving threatening emails from Ms. Broadwell cautioning
her to stay away from her guy, Gen. Petraeus.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Ms. Kelly is presented to us a socialite gadfly who served
as a volunteer hostess for leadership at MacDill AFB, home of CENTCOM. Ms.
Kelly resides with her husband in a posh Tampa bayside residence which hosted
numerous affairs introducing influential members of Tampa society to the
military leadership at MacDill. <a href="http://bit.ly/TNM6fY">Ms. Kelly</a>, however, appears to be <a href="http://patdollard.com/2012/11/jill-kelly-really-jill-khawam-woman-who-launched-fbi-takedown-of-petraeus-and-allen-a-foreign-spy/">more than just a Tampa socialite</a>. Ms. Kelly was known to the WH, visiting the White House
three times. Her social expertise in Tampa was in setting up events for Muslim
interest groups seeking to gain influence at MacDill. Jill (formerly Khawam) Kelly
is a Christian Arab of Lebanese descent, who was well known in the Muslim Arab
embassies of Washington for doing their bidding and hosting their parties at
and near MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. From the Wall Street Journal:</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
"Middle Eastern diplomats in Washington also knew Ms.
Kelley, who came from a Lebanese immigrant family and who helped arrange social
activities when dignitaries from the region visited Tampa, diplomats said. She
also sometimes attended parties at Washington embassies."</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
This might just be one more example of Islamic influence
peddling, except it involves our military. While the American public might believe
we are engaged in a war with Islamists, who represent the views of vast
majority of Muslims in the Middle East, it appears some in our military leadership
are more than willing to socialize with the enemy here in the US. This is old
news for the Obama administration. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></div>

Ms.
Jarrett has no Congressional appointment yet sits at the right hand of the president
with a taxpayer funded Secret Service detail and the title of Senior Adviser.
Ms. Jarrett is well known on the Chicago political and social scene, but little
discussed is the fact that she is Iranian born, to American parents. Less discussed is that her father in law was a Communist, <a href="http://www.trevorloudon.com/2011/06/valerie-jarretts-father-in-law-was-a-communist-worked-with-obama-mentor-frank-marshall-davis/">Vernon Jarrett</a>, who worked closely with the Communist mentor of President Obama, <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/2012/jamie-glazov/the-communist-frank-marshall-davis-the-untold-story-of-barack-obama%E2%80%99s-mentor/">Frank Marshall Davis</a>. Ms. Jarrett believes that the President has a mandate to radically transform US political institutions.
While an amateur politician, she wields incredible power in the Obama White
House. She was the force that led to the departure of two Obama Chiefs of
Staff: Rahm Emmanuel and Bill Daley. In the weeks following Benghazi, <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/israeli-paper-obama-adviser-valerie-jarrett-holding-secret-talks-iran">Jarrett was sent to Qatar</a> to negotiate with the Iranians regarding their nuclear program.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It is as unclear what Ms. Jarrett
negotiated with the Iranians as it is why anyone would send this woman to
conduct such negotiations.</div>

influence, and not just at the Middle East desk. Secretary of State Clinton's
most senior and trusted advisers is <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/312211/huma-abedin-s-muslim-brotherhood-ties-andrew-c-mccarthy?pg=1">Huma Abedin</a>. Abedin, Secretary Clinton&#8217;s
Deputy Chief of Staff, is the wife of disgraced NY Congressman Anthony Wiener,
She has extensive and irrefutable familial ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and
an al-Qaeda financier named Abdullah Omar Naseef. </div>

Prior US Presidents, including <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/05/americans_understanding_islamic_world_better_than_george_w_bush.html">GW Bush</a>, blazed the trail to
the White House for Muslim influence. President Obama, however, has made
"outreach" to the Muslim world a clear priority for his
administration. Could we have envisioned the day where the NASA Director would
be told a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7875584/Barack-Obama-Nasa-must-try-to-make-Muslims-feel-good.html">key mission for NASA</a> was, &#8220;Find a way to reach out to the Muslim
world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel
good about their historic contribution to science, math, and engineering&#8221;? Does
outreach mean we are actually partnered with nations and terrorist groups
determined to destroy us? Learning the truth about Benghazi may answer this
question. Does outreach mean partnering with Islamic elements at the highest
levels of our government? Apparently so. </div>

officials in the Obama administration regarding Benghazi alone, resignations, raincoats
and handcuffs, and criminal charges would be in order. Benghazi, however, is only
the tip of a treacherous iceberg that seeks to sink the American ship of state.
The barbarians are inside the gate and treason doesn&#8217;t begin to describe the reprehensible
sedition and treachery of the Obama administration which allowed this to
happen. </div>
