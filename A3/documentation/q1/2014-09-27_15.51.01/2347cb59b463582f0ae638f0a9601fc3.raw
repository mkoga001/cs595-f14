His father, Michael Brown Sr., said instead of an apology, they would rather see officer Darren Wilson arrested for the death of their son on Aug. 9. \"An apology would be when Darren Wilson has handcuffs, processed and charged with murder,\" Brown Sr. said.\n\nSee also: Police Brutality Videos Blanketed the News This Week \n\nThe young man, who was black, was fatally shot last month by Wilson, who is white.\n\nThe shooting sparked days of violent protests and racial unrest in the predominantly black community. Some residents and civil-rights activists have said responding police officers were overly aggressive, noting their use of tear gas and surplus military vehicles and gear.\n\nJackson released a video apology to Brown's family and Ferguson's predominately African-American community, in which he acknowledged that Brown's body should have been removed from the street much sooner than it was. His remains lay uncovered on Canfield Drive, a residential street, for more than four hours while police collected evidence.\n\n\u201cI want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you\u2019re feeling,\" Jackson said in the video. \"I am truly sorry for the loss of your son.\"\n\nJackson also apologized to protesters in person outside Ferguson Police headquarters earlier this week. Some of the protesters called for Jackson to resign, though he said he had no plans to do so. \n\n\"I don't want words. I want action,\" McSpadden said, who answered \"yes\" when asked whether she thought Jackson should be fired.\n\nBrown's parents are in the nation's capital to meet with lawmakers, and to lobby Congress to pass a law requiring police officers to wear cameras during their interactions with the public. A county grand jury is weighing whether to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether Brown's civil rights were violated.\n\nThe parents also expressed anger at Ferguson police who wore bracelets in support of Wilson. In a letter released Friday, the Justice Department asks Jackson to \"confirm our understanding\" that officers in the suburban St. Louis County department won't wear \"I am Darren Wilson\" bracelets while on duty.\n\nFerguson residents complained about the black bracelets with white lettering this week at a meeting with federal officials. The Brown's family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said the bracelets give an impression that the police lack impartiality in this case.\n\n\"It lets me know how they really feel about the situation, and the wrongness that they do,\" McSpadden said. \"How can you work for the law and act like you're above the law?\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Mashable\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Read on for more details from the memo. \n\nSee also: Stay or Go, Legacy of NFL's Roger Goodell Is Already Set in Stone\n\nNFL executives met on Friday for \"several hours\" with players' union officials to \"continue discussing issues of personal conduct, including training, education, family services, and the disciplinary process.\"\n\nUm, OK. Cool. Although, to be fair, that does seem better than not continuing to discuss those issues. \n\nThe league has also \"continued\" meeting with \"a wide range of groups\" to inform the coming overhaul of the NFL's personal conduct policies, which Goodell said at this press conference last Friday he hopes to have completed by the Super Bowl on Feb. 1. The league has \"met with 11 former players, as well as individuals with law enforcement backgrounds, to discuss their views on standards of conduct, appropriate levels of assistance, and discipline,\" according to Goodell. \n\nThe league has also met with \"senior representatives of the U.S. Army\" to learn more about how it addresses misconduct, including how it offers support services to families and victims, according to Goodell. \n\nGoodell says the NFL has provided promotional time worth $3 million for the anti-domestic violence campaign NoMore.org to run ads during NFL games this weekend, beginning with Thursday night's nationally televised game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants. He says the NFL is \"evaluating how to use our broadcast promotional assets for the rest of the season in support of our efforts to address domestic violence and sexual assault on a broader basis.\"\n\nOK, now we're getting a little warmer perhaps. But this next one is actually pretty cool. \n\nLast week, the National Domestic Violence Hotline announced a longterm commitment (of an undisclosed amount) from the NFL to provide \"much-needed resources\" to help the support center aid domestic abuse victims. Goodell's memo says the NFL's support has already let the hotline hire 10 new \"full-time advocates\" and \"10 more will be hired by the end of next week.\" Together, Goodell says, that will allow the hotline to take up 800 more calls per day. \n\nGiven the NFL's ongoing crisis of credibility and public image, memos like this will do little to mollify its critics. But some steps are better than none, perhaps, and it will take much more time to see if the league is actually able to achieve any meaningful change. \n\nYou can read the full memo here."},"shares":{"twitter":451,"facebook":39,"linked_in":17,"google_plus":3,"total":510},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI3LzMwL1JvZy43NTU5Ny5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/ff843d4b/0de/Rog.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI3LzMwL1JvZy43NTU5Ny5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNzV4MTc1IwplCWpwZw/78c70103/0de/Rog.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI3LzMwL1JvZy43NTU5Ny5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkzNTB4MzUwIwplCWpwZw/e9872668/0de/Rog.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI3LzMwL1JvZy43NTU5Ny5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk4MHg4MCMKZQlqcGc/b26108e1/0de/Rog.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI3LzMwL1JvZy43NTU5Ny5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNjB4MTYwIwplCWpwZw/9a9f0285/0de/Rog.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1wO0B7c","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2014/09/11/roger-goodell-legacy/"}]},"excerpt":"One week after his disaster of a press conference last Friday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to teams detailing what the league has so far done to improve its handling of domestic violence acts by players.\r\n","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/"},{"_id":"5425f4b0b589e40b090023bc","id":"2014/09/26/shy-tuttle-tennessee-beyonce","title":"The Secret to College Football Recruiting?

It is expected to be given final approval by the House of Representatives next week.\n\nSee also: #LifeBeforeAbbott: Australians Remember The Days Before Prime Minister\n\nThe bill allows the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to access a network of computers, including computers not belonging to people of concern, using a single warrant. The number of computers within a network has not been defined.\n\n\u201cThere is no arbitrary or artificial limit on the number of devices,\u201d Attorney General George Brandis told the Senate.\n\nThe Australian spy agency will be able to disrupt target computers and access the devices through any third-party networks required. Once the target computer with which the warrant is related to is reached, ASIO has the ability to delete or modify data as it sees fit.\n\nIn addition to the new ASIO digital monitoring powers, the bill also introduces a 10 year jail sentence for journalists or whistleblowers disclosing information in regards to \"special intelligence operations.\"\n\nThe bill passed Senate 44 to 12. The Coalition Government, the opposition Labor Party, the Family First Party and Palmer United Party backed the bill, while the Greens and independent senators opposed the bill.\n\nThe Greens and other crossbenchers unsuccessfully attempted to introduce amendments that would require the ASIO to report on their activities. Instead, the Palmer United Party triumphed in its request to get the penalty for exposing an ASIO officer's identity increased from one year behind bars to ten years.\n\nPalmer United Party Senator Glen Lazarus said harsher penalties were needed, as \"the internet poses one of the greatest threats to our existence.\"\n\nThe leader of the Greens party, Christine Milne, said in the marathon debate last night that the new laws could affect journalists and whistleblowers by giving too much power to the government.\n\n\"We are doing away with freedoms of the press that have been fought for a long period of time and have now been given away,\" she said.\n\nGreens communications spokesman Scott Ludlam said it will give ASIO the power to spy on anyone, anywhere.\n\n\"These warrants will allow ASIO, or those working for ASIO, to modify these computers, to delete files, to install malware, to seek higher levels of user access and to impersonate people \u2014 not only on a particular specified device but, as I think we have well and truly established, on any device that it is connected to or is considered to be in a relationship with,\" he said\n\nThe attorney general rejected these concerns, saying the aim of the bill was not to target journalists, but to have powers to punish whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden.\n\nAnother set of anti-terror laws which will deal with Australians travelling to terror hotspots without a reasonable excuse is set to be debated over the next few weeks.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Report podcast, the sports media behemoth probably didn't expect this: The hashtag #FreeSimmons becoming a worldwide Twitter trend almost immediately, and being posted more than 40,000 times by midday Thursday. \n\nSimmons has so far remained mum on the issue, but it's more than just a suspension. Coupled with the conglomerate's coverage of the NFL's current domestic violence, credibility and public-image crisis, it's a window into the complicated, contradictory beast that is ESPN. \n\nSee also: Finally, Say Goodbye to Derek Jeter and the Longest Goodbye in History\n\nESPN's vast array of TV channels, websites and publications represent, at different times: a reporting powerhouse; a bloviation factory; a news-coverer; a news-maker; awesome; awful; and everything in between. ESPN contains the best in sports media, and it contains the most cynical in sports media. \n\nIt drives the sports conversation in America -- while oftentimes shaping it. \n\nAnd Simmons is the company's biggest star. After being hired as a columnist for ESPN.com in 2001, he rose to demigod status among many sports fans and aspiring sportswriters. Thirteen years later, he oversees a spinoff site, the well-regarded Grantland, frequently appears on TV and is seen by many as untouchable at the company despite past run-ins with management. Much of the sports-writing you read on the web today derives from the conversational, openly-biased style Simmons made his name with a decade ago. \n\nThat, for the uninitiated, is what makes Simmons' suspension interesting. He's not just another one of ESPN's many famous faces -- he's on another level entirely. ESPN suspended him on Wednesday ostensibly for ripping Goodell viciously and profanely; Simmons called the commissioner a \"liar\" and said the NFL's handling of its Ray Rice investigation is \"such fucking bullshit\" on his podcast on Monday.\n\nMost following the NFL lately would agree with that second point. Many would agree with the first. \n\nBut thickening the plot is this: ESPN's suspension of its biggest star came just one day after ESPN ombudsman Robert Lipsyte wrote a Tuesday blog post titled \"ESPN flexes journalistic muscle on Rice.\" Lipsyte credited Simmons by name for unspecified \"verbal punches\" in the column's fourth paragraph. \n\nThe network\u2019s heavyweights -- Keith Olbermann, Jason Whitlock and Bill Simmons, among others -- delivered their own verbal punches; investigative reporter Don Van Natta Jr. has been driving the national media\u2019s newsgathering; Bob Ley anchored smart and thoughtful discussions; and a roster of stars, including Jane McManus, Dan Le Batard, Hannah Storm, Andrew Brandt, Adam Schefter and Chris Mortensen, offered information and insight. \n\nI\u2019d like to say I wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised \u2026 but I was. \n\nESPN and the NFL, getting rich together\n\nSkepticism typically abounds when ESPN covers the NFL. The network and league are broadcast partners, raking in cash by the truckload together. ESPN was rightfully criticized for pulling out late from a partnership with Frontline on a damning documentary last fall called League of Denial. That program was based on a book of the same name by Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada -- brothers and Pulitzer Prize winners who work for ESPN -- about how the NFL has for decades attempted to obfuscate research on the longterm impact of head trauma sustained by players. \n\nOn Friday afternoon, another two of ESPN's most respected reporters published a strong report about tactics employed by the NFL and Baltimore Ravens to shield Rice from harsh punishment. Despite some issues that emerged later, the report seemed to help represent a different tack from ESPN on the NFL's most current crisis. \n\nThen came Simmons' suspension. \n\nCynicism about ESPN's coverage of the NFL exploded on Twitter shortly after the company announced Simmons' suspension when Lipsyte's column disappeared from the site. An ESPN spokesperson told Mashable that was the result of a simple bug that impacted all of the site's blogs, and Lipsyte's page reappeared shortly after vanishing.  \n\nBut ESPN did intentionally remove the episode of Simmons' podcast in which he blasted Goodell. \n\n\"We felt it would be appropriate to take down the podcast,\" a company spokesman told Mashable on Thursday. \n\nHere, via a Mediaite transcription, are Simmons' full comments on Goodell from his Monday podcast. \n\nGoodell, if he didn\u2019t know what was on that tape, he\u2019s a liar. I\u2019m just saying it. He is lying. I think that dude is lying. If you put him up on a lie detector test that guy would fail. For all these people to pretend they didn\u2019t know is such fucking bullshit. It really is \u2014 it\u2019s such fucking bullshit. And for him to go in that press conference and pretend otherwise, I was so insulted. I really was\n\nThe real reason Simmons was suspended?\n\nThose comments might strike some as harsh but, as noted by Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch and others, Simmons was far from the first ESPN employee to blast Goodell on air. He cursed a few times, sure, but suspending him struck many as odd given that Simmons is essentially paid to be opinionated. \n\nFurther muddying the waters was that ESPN suspended talking-head Stephen A. Smith for just one week for comments partially blaming women for their role in domestic violence cases. Heck, Simmons' three-week ban is longer than Goodell initially suspended Rice for decking his fianc\u00e9e last February. \n\nESPN's full announcement of Simmons' suspension read like this:\n\nEvery employee must be accountable to ESPN and those engaged in our editorial operations must also operate within ESPN\u2019s journalistic standards. We have worked hard to ensure that our recent NFL coverage has met that criteria. Bill Simmons did not meet those obligations in a recent podcast, and as a result we have suspended him for three weeks.\n\nBut it was Simmons' comments shortly after lambasting Goodell that many suspect actually got him suspended. Here's what he said:\n\nI really hope somebody calls me or emails me and says I\u2019m in trouble for anything I say about Roger Goodell. Because if one person says that to me, I\u2019m going public. You leave me alone. The commissioner\u2019s a liar and I get to talk about that on my podcast. Please, call me and say I\u2019m in trouble. I dare you.\n\nThe columnist had previously been reprimanded for criticizing ESPN, but Monday's outright dare represented a new level of hubris. And now he's paying the price after that dare was taken. \n\nJason McIntyre of The Big Lead -- a reliably-connected source on sports media matters -- wrote on Thursday morning that ESPN President John Skipper \"is livid\" Simmons challenged higher-ups so openly. \n\nSimmons' first public comments upon his return will certainly be illuminating. He has the profile to land on his feet elsewhere, should he decide to leave ESPN. Those 40,000 #FreeSimmons tweets that appeared almost overnight speak to the power of his personal brand. \n\nWhile Simmons-gate perfectly encapsulates ESPN's duality as both news-reporter and news-maker, only time will tell if this most public of tiffs leads to any larger fallout. \n\nBONUS: 25 of YouTube's Funniest Sports Fails\n\n\t\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Miller said Thursday through an NFL spokesman that he never received the video.\n\nSee also: Ravens Owner Fires Back at ESPN's Ray Rice Report\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release details of the case, said he doesn't know if Miller ever saw the DVD or opened the package. His only communication with the NFL was a 12-second voicemail on April 9 from league offices confirming receipt of the package, in which a woman says, \"You're right. It's terrible.\"\n\nThe official told the AP two weeks ago that he sent the video to the NFL, but asked the AP not to report that he had addressed the package to Miller. He eliminated that restriction Thursday.\n\n\"Since the NFLPA and NFL have launched separate investigations into the league and the Ravens' handling of Ray Rice's case, I want to make a few things clear. No one from the NFL ever asked me for the inside-elevator video,\" the official said Thursday. \"I mailed it anonymously to Jeff Miller because he's their head of security. I attached a note saying: 'Ray Rice elevator video. You have to see it. It's terrible.' I provided a number for a disposable cellphone and asked for confirmation that it was received. I knew there was a possibility Mr. Miller may not get the video, but I hoped it would land in the right hands.\"\n\nMiller, in London preparing for the Raiders-Dolphins game Sunday, issued a statement to the AP Thursday night through an NFL spokesman.\n\n\"I unequivocally deny that I received at any time a copy of the video, and I had not watched it until it was made public on September 8,\" he said.\n\nMiller joined the league in 2008 as director of strategic security and was promoted to chief security officer in April 2011. Before joining the NFL, Miller spent nearly six years as the commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police. He worked for the state police for 24 years.\n\nAt the NFL, Miller's responsibilities include overseeing investigative programs and services. He is also in charge of event security and game integrity.  \n\nSee also: NFL Union Appeals Ray Rice Suspension, Wants Roger Goodell Off the Case\n\nIt remains unclear what happened to the video once it arrived at league offices. There are two NFL executives named Jeffrey Miller, but the law enforcement official didn't know that, and intended it to go to the chief of security. The official said he wanted to make sure the NFL had the video before deciding on Rice's punishment.\n\n\"My intention wasn't to bring down Commissioner Goodell or anyone else at the NFL,\" he said.\n\nHe said he didn't know the identity of the woman who left him the voicemail. He said he chose Miller because of his law enforcement background, even though he didn't know him personally.\n\nRice, a former Pro Bowl running back for the Baltimore Ravens, was arrested in Atlantic City on an assault charge for hitting Janay Palmer in February. A police summons stated that Rice had struck Palmer with his hand, knocking her unconscious. Rice has been accepted into New Jersey's pretrial intervention program, which enabled him to avoid jail time and could result in having the charge expunged from his record.\n\nInitially, Goodell suspended Rice \u2014 who has since married Palmer \u2014 for two games. After criticism, Goodell announced new stiffer penalties for future domestic violence cases. After video of the punch in the casino elevator was released, the Ravens cut Rice and Goodell suspended him indefinitely.\n\nLeague and Ravens officials said they requested the video from law enforcement, but were denied. ESPN and others have reported that the Ravens had a detailed description of the video shortly after Rice was arrested.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Not director George Lucas, but a man four years his senior: independent film producer Gary Kurtz. \n\nKurtz was also the producer of the next movie in the series, the even more highly-regarded Empire Strikes Back, directed by Irvin Kershner. But Kurtz and Lucas parted ways late into the production of Empire, under circumstances that have been shrouded in mystery -- and Kurtz's role in the foundation of the Star Wars franchise has been debated by fans ever since. \n\nOh, and fans of the rival franchise, Star Trek -- get ready for a pleasant surprise.\n\n See also: A New Star Wars Universe Begins ... Now\n\nFor my book How Star Wars Conquered the Universe, I caught up with Kurtz, 74, who now lives in the UK. Over the course of several hours, I asked him about some persistent myths that have surrounded the original movie -- from the origins of the Force to whether it was really supposed to be \"Episode IV\" of a larger story from the beginning.\n\nHere are some highlights from that interview, along with a selection of rarely-seen Star Wars photos from Kurtz's personal archive. \n\nOn the real origin of Star Wars: the 1930s and 1940s Flash Gordon serials.\n\nGary Kurtz: I'm sure you know the stories. We tried to buy the rights to Flash Gordon from King Features [in 1971]. They weren\u2019t adverse to discussing it, but their restrictions were so draconian that we realized right away that it wasn\u2019t really a great prospect at the time. \n\nSo they started talking about \"The Star Wars,\" which was to be ...\n\nSome kind of Flash-Gordon-like science fiction story, which hadn\u2019t been done for a long, long time. The last proper space opera type of science fiction was probably Forbidden Planet in 1955. Since then, all the science fiction seemed to go downhill towards either Creature from the Black Lagoon type-horror, or alien invasion from space, or just this dystopian kind of depressing stories about post-apocalyptic society. And none of that was fun. \n\nIt was just the idea of capturing the energy of the Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers style of space opera, which hadn\u2019t been done for so long. It was really during American Graffiti that we discussed it a lot, because it was on the paperwork when we made [an earlier, soon-abandoned] deal with United Artists for two pictures. One was a 1950s rock and roll movie, and one was an unnamed science fiction film. \n\nThat was about the extent of the description at the time. There was no idea of what that science fiction movie would be like. We did discuss Flash-Gordon-type stories at great lengths. \n\nAs for nerds who insist Star Wars was drawn from one of George Lucas' favorite Akira Kurasawa movies, The Hidden Fortress ... \n\nNot really. There are definite comparisons, there\u2019s no question, if you want to look hard enough: the two peasants, and the idea of transporting a princess across hostile territory. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward action adventure. But I mean, they\u2019re very generic.\n\nIf you read all the versions [of Star Wars] you know that the story is progressive. The characters change a lot. \n\nOr that it was based on Joseph Campbell's famous book on mythology, The Hero With a Thousand Faces ...\n\nThe whole idea of Star Wars as a mythological thing, I think came about because of [later Lucas] interviews that tied it to The Hero with a Thousand Faces [which Lucas didn't read until he'd almost finished Star Wars]. \n\nActually, if you look carefully at it, all coming of age stories fit [Campbell's model]. Hollywood has done those kind of stories since the beginning, since the 1920s. So there are many, many examples of stories that fit the model of that hero. \n\nI think it did kind of cloud it a bit, that Star Wars got so closely tied to that. It was even more so when George did a long interview about the book and about the connections. There are definite connections there, but I think that\u2019s a bit too analytical. \n\nBut was Star Wars actually more influenced by the Star Trek TV series, which was undergoing a hugely popular revival in syndication in the early 1970s?\n\nYes. [George] did talk about that [show] quite a bit. I mean Star Trek, the early series, was pretty much all human drama. There was a touch of humor in it, but most of it was down to relationship stories. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of intergalactic battles. They didn\u2019t have any money. \n\nBut it was set in this kind of futuristic kind of environment that was inspiring. It freed up the mind to think about what would it be like to travel to distant galaxies and encounter other species. I think that that definitely was one of the influences -- because that\u2019s what Flash Gordon was like too. \n\nStar Wars wasn't science fiction, Kurtz and Lucas kept telling 20th Century Fox -- it was space fantasy.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey was released in 1968, and it took seven years to make its money back. So we didn\u2019t want to use it as a role model for Star Wars, because it was much too esoteric and serious a film. We were not looking to make a film like 2001 in any way -- except for the fact that the hardcore science fiction fans that did go to see 2001 would probably go see Star Wars. \n\nSo, we presented it on the basis that if only the hardcore science fiction audience went to see this film, it would still make enough money to make its [$8 million] budget back, and then maybe a small profit. So it didn\u2019t have to have any other audience, and the risk would be low enough that it should be worthwhile. \n\nHarrison Ford had a reputation for drinking on the set of American Graffiti -- but cleaned up his act in time for Star Wars. \n\nI remember one night [on Graffiti] when we were doing the drag race [scene] down the main street in San Rafael. The first night we were shooting that, when Harrison had been drinking a little bit, and I had a bit of a set-to with him, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t have anybody drinking when we\u2019re doing a driving scene at all. Don\u2019t show up like this again,\u201d and he didn\u2019t. That was the end of that. \n\nOff the set there was quite a bit of drinking around the motel. That\u2019s when Richard Dreyfuss got thrown in the swimming pool, which was unfortunate because he hit his nose.\n\nStar Wars was actually a pretty cheap movie -- and nobody at Fox cared much about it. \n\nWe went in and told Fox originally that we could do it for $7 million. That was definitely a finger-in-the-wind time. But when the Fox Visual Effects Department did an analysis of the script, they thought the visual effects alone would cost $7 million. We ended up with kind of a $9 million official budget, and then it ended up being $10.1 million [less than the average studio comedy at the time]. \n\nAnd we were scrambling at the end of shooting. I had to call Laddie [Alan Ladd Jr., Fox production chief and Star Wars champion] and ask for $50,000 more so that we could build one more set, so that we could shoot that scene of people running up and down the blockade runner hallways before Darth Vader and the Stormtroopers break in. \n\nThat was the last thing we shot. All the main actors had gone home and we were scrambling to finish by a fixed date in July because the Fox board had insisted that we finish. \n\nI had long discussions on the phone with Laddie and the production department, saying \"to do this, we\u2019re going to have to put on a second unit,\" which we did, and I directed that unit just so that we could finish by that date. I said \"this is costing us more than just extending the schedule for a week, as is using the main unit rather than hiring a second unit and shooting at the same time.\" \n\nBut they didn\u2019t care. They wanted it done by that fixed date. At that point, I don\u2019t think many people at Fox had any feeling for what was going to happen and what it was going to be like. They just wanted to get it done and wrapped up, and it was just a kind of minor annoyance to them.\n\nThe original Star Wars wasn't really supposed to be called \"Episode IV\" back in 1977.\n\nWe were toying with the idea of calling it Episode III, IV, or V -- something in the middle. Fox hated that idea. They said it\u2019ll really confuse the audience -- and actually they were right. If you go to see a film, and it\u2019s been touted as this new science fiction film, and it says Episode III up there, you\u2019d say, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n\nWe were a bit clouded by the fact that we wanted it to be as much like Flash Gordon as possible. Because if you went to Saturday morning pictures and came in and saw episode eight of Flash Gordon, you\u2019d have the scroll at the beginning, the rollup, which we imitated. So we thought that would be really clever. But it was stupid at the time, because it\u2019d be impossible to explain to anybody what it meant. \n\nEven Kurtz describes early Star Wars drafts as \"gobbledygook.\"\n\nPeople who read it felt that way. Fox, when they read it, even Laddie said \"it\u2019s really difficult.\" Anybody reading those drafts now has the film in their mind. But at the time, what you saw on paper was only enhanced by 12 drawings from Ralph McQuarrie, and that was it. There was no other way to visualize exactly what we were talking about. So, it did sound like gobbledygook in a lot of ways. \n\nTo a lot of people who read some of those early drafts, it was amazing how well the films came out. Some of that is down to editing. The film is edited quite differently to the way the script went. You know of course that [screenwriters and student friends of Lucas'] Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz came in at the last minute, and gave it what essentially was a comedy polish. That helped immensely, because that last draft before their influence was a little too serious. \n\nOn how The Force evolved through different drafts of the script -- with the benefit of Kurtz's student textbooks on Comparative Religion.\n\nAt one time, the energy [of the Force] was all tied up in crystals, in the \"Kaibur Crystal.\" That was the source of the Force. But we had no time to deal with exposition about esoteric religion. What we were looking for was a simple handle on something that could be explained really quickly. \n\nYou know, when you\u2019re out in the real world, religion is identified by handles. You\u2019re either a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew or a Buddhist or Hindu. As soon as you say one of those words, you know what\u2019s behind that, even if you haven\u2019t studied any of those religions. You know kind of what that person might be like. \n\nWe wanted something like that with a religion that nobody\u2019s ever heard of. So the idea of the Force is this energy thing. The fact that Ben Kenobi could say in one sentence pretty much what it was all about, and then we move on. \n\nThat\u2019s how it got boiled down to practically nothing -- and it worked much better that way, much better. \n\nWe did have long discussions about various religious philosophies, and how people related to them, and how we could simplify it. \"May the Force be with you\" came out of medieval Christianity, where \"may God go with you\" was a symbol that you would be safe. We wanted something as simple as that, an everyday expression that linked to the power of the Force that wasn\u2019t overbearing. \n\nOn George Lucas' frequent claim that he made Star Wars by taking the first draft, chopping it into thirds -- which then became the original trilogy:\n\nThat\u2019s not true. There were a lot of little bits and pieces that were reasonably good ideas and that ended up being in the final draft. But once the final draft was actually locked and the Huycks did their polish on it, there wasn\u2019t enough material to do other movies. \n\nThere were some odd ideas that got thrown out, like the Wookiee planet; that was a cost factor. There were some other ideas that might have been included if there was more budget. Some of those ended up in later films. But [George's story on how it is written] is perpetuated by the fact that he and I did interviews at the time of the opening of Star Wars, saying we took a section out of the middle because there was too much material and we want to do more films. \n\nAfter the film opened, Fox said, \u201cCan you do another one?\u201d And we said it\u2019s possible, but for cost purposes it would be better if we committed to two more because we can amortize the cost of sets and everything that way. So that\u2019s really what happened. But the story material was not fully formed. \n\n20th Century Fox was kind of a mess at the time. \n\nThe chairman of the board, Dennis Stanfill, was not happy with some of what Fox was doing and it wasn\u2019t anything to do with Star Wars. In the year that Star Wars was made, two prestige pictures were being shot that were costing two-and-a-half times as much as Star Wars. There was Turning Point, with Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft, about ballet dancing. And Julia with Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda. \n\nBoth of those were not expected to make a lot of money, but they were elegant projects. That was at a time when these studios all did that. They made potboilers and they made action pictures and they made small art house pictures, they made prestige pictures that they expected to win awards. Getting that balance right was never easy. \n\nFox had another film out that summer called The Other Side of Midnight, which was a kind of potboiler novel. It was a terrible film, but it was a soap opera, and there is an audience for that. So it did reasonably well. But in a lot of cases, the only way they got The Other Side of Midnight playing in the cinema was to say we\u2019ll tie it to Star Wars. They worked it both ways. Those cinemas that were interested in The Other Side of Midnight but didn\u2019t care about Star Wars, they had to take Star Wars anyway.\n\nEventually the Fox board decided they wanted to see a rough cut of the movie -- at the worst possible time.\n\nThe board [including Princess Grace of Monaco] came to the mix one night. We could only work at night because the mixing theater was busy during the day. We were supposed to mix at Warner Brothers and their big stage, and we got preempted by Clint Eastwood and his film [The Gauntlet]; he was a much bigger name at Warner Brothers than we were. Goldwyn didn\u2019t have any time either, but the head of Goldwyn said, \u201cWell, I could let you work at night, and we\u2019ll pull in another crew.\u201d So, we worked from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. every day. \n\nThe board came in when we were just finishing up the [very unusual at the time] Dolby stereo mix. They came at the beginning of our session, at 8 p.m. I don\u2019t think we had any titles then. No end titles or anything. \n\nThe board sat there and watched the film, and at the end they got up and left, not a word. No applause, not even a smile. They just got up and left. We were really depressed. Stanfill came up to me right at the very end, he was the last one to leave. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about them. They don\u2019t know anything about movies.\u201d\n\nStar Wars was not an immediate hit at its first test screening with an audience, either -- contrary to Lucasfilm legend.\n\nThe audience was generally favorably inclined to the picture. It wasn\u2019t a revolutionary response. It was polite, and positive and most of the [audience survey] cards were quite positive. But I have one still, framed, where this guy -- I think he\u2019s 22 years old -- he said \u201cThis is the worst film I\u2019ve ever seen since Godzilla versus the Smog Monster.\u201d \n\nThe infamous Star Wars Holiday Special, often described as the worst TV show of all time, wasn't always that awful.\n\nIt did start out to be a lot better [with a different script]. We had half a dozen meetings with the TV company that was making it. In the end, because of work on promoting Star Wars and working on the next film, we realized we had no time. So we just left it to them and just had the occasional meetings with them, provided them with access to props and the actors, and that was it. \n\nWe were kind of appalled as it got towards air time as to what was happening with it. Everybody kind of walked away. It was a bad mistake. In the long run, it wouldn\u2019t have been necessary even to do anything. It happened because Fox was worried that three years was too long to wait for the second film, and that something needed to be out there in the meantime. It really didn\u2019t. \n\nOn how he left the production of Empire Strikes Back, which got delayed and went way over budget:\n\nHoward [Kazanjian, who took over production on Empire and Return of the Jedi] was around. He was doing American Graffiti 2. I was talking to Jim Henson about The Dark Crystal, because he wanted to go ahead with it and I said I can\u2019t do it because I\u2019m tied up with the Star Wars thing. \n\nI think George had it in his mind that he could direct the film remotely by telling [Irvin] Kershner what to do, and Kersh was not that kind of director. George only came over [to London] a few times during the shooting; Kersh said, \u201cLook, you hired me to make this movie, I\u2019m going to make it.\u201d And he did. He was a bit slow sometimes, and we did have to use a second unit a couple of times. I directed the second unit after John Barry died suddenly in the first week. So that threw us. \n\nMark Hamill sprained his wrist and arm and couldn\u2019t do anything for a little while. So it did run long. We had weather problems in Norway -- the worst blizzard in Northern Europe in the last 40 years. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been to a movie location anywhere where a local hasn\u2019t come up at one point saying, \u201cYou should have been here last year, the weather was a lot better.\u201d \n\n[Kershner] was very good with the actors and he was a bit slow. The visual effects team made fun of him sometimes because he would stage a scene and they would say, \u201cOkay, Boba Fett\u2019s going to shoot at Luke here so you want bullet hits here and here,\u201d and they\u2019d mark in pencil so they\u2019re going to drill holes and put these squibs in. Inevitably, they\u2019d say, \u201cAre you sure now? Are you sure this is where you want them?\u201d So they\u2019d drill the holes and they\u2019d put the squibs in and then cover them up. \n\nAnd then he\u2019d do a rehearsal and then he\u2019d change his mind, and they\u2019d have to put new ones in somewhere else. \n\nI tried to rein him in a bit and by taking over the second unit. I was able to get some of the stuff done, like Luke in the ice caves with the Wampa, for instance. I shot all that. Peter Suschitzky, who was the cameraman, was very, very helpful in terms of making sure that the lighting in the second unit matched the first unit and everybody worked really hard. \n\nI think Kersh did an outstanding job. The difference between Star Wars and Empire from a performance point of view is, I think, striking. It\u2019s not only better written, but its performances are much less comic book-like, and darker and more realistic. \n\nReturn of the Jedi became \"less serious\" -- because of Indiana Jones.\n\nIn the meantime, George had worked with Stephen [Spielberg] on Raiders of the Lost Ark. He was convinced by the end of Empire that it needed less serious stories and more rollercoaster ride. He changed the story outline for Jedi and we had a kind of mutual parting of the ways, because I just didn\u2019t want to do another attack on the Death Star. \n\nThe original story outline that we had for the third film I thought would have been great. It was darker and it ended up with Luke riding off into the sunset, metaphorically, on his own. And that would have been a bittersweet ending but I think it would have been dramatically stronger. \n\nBut the official Lucasfilm account of the making of Return of the Jedi says there was no early draft without Death Stars?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t ever that way and it never was shot that way. That was just a discussion. This all came up at the time that Empire was being written, because the idea was that they had to tie together. \n\nI had some written materials somewhere. It was about how are we going to resolve the story of these three people; one of the discussions was about Han Solo\u2019s character being killed in one of the raids in the middle of the story. Harrison wanted it to be that way. He wanted his character to end that way. So there was that and there was the princess having to take control of what\u2019s left of her people, and be crowned queen. \n\nBut I think what happened was that there were discussions with the marketing people and the toy company. They said, \u201cOh, no, you can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t kill off one of your main characters. It\u2019s too salable.\u201d In a way that still happens today with superhero movies. There\u2019s no poignancy anywhere. It\u2019s just a lot of action. But there\u2019s no threat to any main characters. I guess that\u2019s inevitable in this kind of situation where nobody wants to lose anything like that that\u2019s important. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not sure that that ever got down to a complete story outline. It was dismissed very early on as being possibly too melancholic and not upbeat enough for big endings. \n\nChris Taylor is the author of How Star Wars Conquered the Universe, the first complete history of the Star Wars franchise and its fandom.\n\nTo hear audio clips from the Gary Kurtz interview, check out the Full of Sith podcast here.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Ronnie Hampton said three young women from the team died at the scene, and a fourth woman died at a hospital in nearby Sulphur, the Oklahoman reported. None of the victims were identified.\n\nHampton said the team's coach, who was driving the bus, declined treatment at the scene and escaped without serious injury. He said 15 other bus passengers were hurt, as was the driver of the tractor-trailer, who was expected to survive.\n\n\"Right now, it's being investigated like a homicide,\" Hampton said, adding that both drivers will undergo standard toxicology tests. Hampton said details of the crash were still not known but \"something happened to cause (the semi-tractor driver) to depart the roadway and impact the other vehicle.\"\n\nHe said the accident will remain under investigation for several weeks.\n\nHampton said the semi crossed the median and veered into the southbound lanes, hitting the bus.\n\n\"When it impacted the bus, it just kept going and went off the side of road. ... We knew we had a two-vehicle accident by what we saw at the scene. ... But it took about an hour before we found the semi,\" he said.\n\nThe front end of the team van was virtually untouched, but the sides of the vehicle were heavily damaged.

Demonstrators adopted the phrase \"I am Mike Brown,\" early on, which, like \"I am Darren Wilson\" has been printed on merchandise.\n\nSee also: Ferguson Police Chief's Apology Was 6 Weeks Too Late for Protesters\n\nAn official at DOJ, which launched a civil rights investigation into the Ferguson police department following the shooting, wrote in the letter to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, that the bracelets have \"upset and agitated\" Ferguson residents, who showed federal authorities pictures of police wearing them while policing protests earlier this week. \n\nWhile the department appreciates self expression, the bracelets are adding fuel to a fire still burning in Ferguson, Christy Lopez, deputy chief of the civil rights division's special litigation section said in the publicly released letter. \n\nWe are keenly aware of the importance of individual expression of opinions, even those that some find offensive, insensitive, or harmful. We also acknowledge that the message that many officers intend to convey by wearing these bracelets may be different than the message received by many of those who see these bracelets. \n\nNonetheless, there is no question that police departments can and should closely regulate officers' professional appearance and behavior, particularly where, as here, the expressive accessory itself is exacerbating an already tense atmosphere between law enforcement and residents in Ferguson. These bracelets reinforce the very \"us versus them\" mentality that many residents of Ferguson believe exists.\n\nSome of the officers who were photographed wearing the bracelets also blacked out their name plates with tapes, which is against Ferguson police policies. It's unclear which police department the officers wearing the bracelets were from, Lopez said, adding that county and state law enforcement will also abide by the prohibition. \n\n\"As you are all too aware, the actions of other police officers while in Ferguson can impact your community as much as the actions of your own officers,\" she said. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

Defying expectations that it would be a satirical takedown of Toronto's embattled mayor, however, the show instead delivered a sympathetic portrayal of Ford -- albeit one that was bogged down by cheap laughs and frenetic pacing.\n\nSee also: 'Rob Ford The Musical' Hopefuls Do Their Best Impressions in 6 Seconds\n\n\"We were very concerned. We considered all of our options,\" producer Brett McCaig told Mashable. \"[But] we had no choice other than that the show must go on.\"\n\nMcCaig came out on stage before Friday night's show last week to extend his \"sympathies and prayers,\" and to tell the packed theater that staff would be collecting donations for the Canadian Cancer Society following curtain call. In addition, one cast member held a handwritten \"Get well\" sign at the musical's conclusion. Other than that, though, Rob Ford the Musical remained completely unchanged. \"Everything was intact,\" McCaig said. \n\nBut perhaps it should not have been. McCaig and his team would've been wise to edit down the musical, which often felt like a nonsensical hodgepodge of pop-culture and local-news references that overwhelmed its few shining moments. \n\n\"Narrated\" by a sardonic Margaret Atwood (Lisa Horner), Rob Ford the Musical follows Ford (Sheldon Bergstrom) as he embarks on a personal journey in the vein of It's a Wonderful Life, after collapsing from a brain aneurysm. His spiritual guide is a black transgender angel named Transgression -- appropriately ironic, given Ford's contentious history with the LGBT community -- who is a combination of all the worst stereotypes of gay and black culture (i.e. flamboyant, sassy and overtly sexual).\n\nTransgression, frequently the source of groan-inducing, middle school-esque jokes about genitals and Ford's girth, is helping the Toronto mayor in the hopes of scoring C-cup breasts. She leads Ford through the past four years of his tenure at City Hall, revisiting key moments, including the mayor's refusal to attend Toronto's annual pride parade, the revelation that he inappropriately sought donations to his football foundation under official city council letterhead, and of course, the crack scandal. (Confusingly, unlike It's a Wonderful Life, Ford isn't just a passive observer; he is actually able to interact with people from his past. But for some unexplainable reason, Ford acts like he is encountering these scenarios for the first time. Transgression, meanwhile, is invisible to everyone but Ford.)\n\nPortrayed as wiser and more calculating, Doug Ford (Justin Bott) frequently gives advice to the mayor. It's a representation, however, that doesn't reflect reality, as the actual Doug is almost as gaffe-prone as his brother. To add to the discrepancy, Bott looks nothing like his real-life counterpart, who is at least 10 years older and 20 pounds heavier. Rob Ford the Musical also plays up the sibling rivalry between Rob and Doug, though both brothers are actually staunch supporters of each other. (McCaig said the musical is just his version of events. \"It's a musical comedy, and this was just our take on the whole thing,\" he told Mashable.)\n\nOther characters, including Toronto police chief Bill Blair (played by Sheldon Davis who is the real-life Blair's physical opposite), Tennessee Williams-obsessed lawyer Ruby (Marisa McIntyre) and dimwitted journalist Eddie (Daniel Greenberg) are woefully underdeveloped, and spend the majority of the musical spewing asinine babble. Case in point: Eddie refers to his \"winky\" getting aroused multiple times, and randomly says \"Nobody beats the brick! Nooobody!\" at one point.\n\nRob Ford the Musical is somewhat self-aware, occasionally recognizing when jokes intentionally fall flat. However, the many references are heavy-handed, and it often felt like McCaig couldn't decide which ones he wanted to include, and so unwisely added them all. As a result, the musical touches on many different topics, but fails to go beyond the superficial. There is never any genuinely biting satire. \n\nIn addition, a large screen shows clips of Ford's comical blunders through the years, including his football fail and camera crash. The sparse stage in front the screen has five vertical banners, featuring landmarks from around downtown Toronto.\n\nRob Ford the Musical does not miss every mark, though. One memorable musical number is a duet called \"F*ck You,\" the highlight of which is a verse that the Ford brothers sing in Jamaican patois -- naturally, referencing another infamous video of Rob.\n\nOverall, however, the musical falls flat. Ford is portrayed as a misunderstood man who is ignorant and unconfident, but has good intentions. Meanwhile, the media and police are presented as one-dimensional villains, and at one point even conspire to take Ford down by giving him crack. This may be a sympathetic portrayal of the mayor, but it lacks a critical eye. In reality, Ford was largely the author of his own misfortune. \n\nDespite these flaws, audience members that Mashable interviewed last week thoroughly enjoyed the musical. Here are some of their views:\r\n\u201cIt really shows the vulnerability that you don\u2019t necessarily see anywhere else.\u201d - Jacob Gow\r\n\u201cI felt it was quite a sympathetic expression of it all.\u201d - Susan Greenfield\r\n\"It really looked at his hardships that he\u2019s been enduring in his life ... The side that they looked at or depicted was more of a softer side than what the media was always setting out and what the media was always talking about.\u201d - Jeannie Ueno\n\nInterestingly, these comments are consistent with Ford's public persona as a man of the people.  \r\n   \r\nRob Ford the Musical runs from Sept. 15 to 28.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

The twist? It's currently only available on BitTorrent. It's a bit of an unconventional choice, but is in tune with the Radiohead frontman's past methods. In 2007, the band released seventh album In Rainbows online, allowing fans to pay whatever they wanted. The band's follow-up, 2011's The King of Limbs, was put out online a day earlier than planned.\n\nSee also: Surprise! 12 Musicians Who Ignore Traditional Publicity\n\nThis new pairing for Yorke's sophomore solo effort with BitTorrent has spawned numerous reactions, from peeved to perplexed to positively pleased.\n\nDear Thom Yorke: What the heck is Bit Torrent and can I listen to it on my iTunes?\u2014 Brisblondie (@Brisblondie) September 26, 2014\n\nA bit torrent bundle is so out of the way.. what is this 2001?\u2014 THE RULER (@RUCKAZOID) September 26, 2014\n\nGlad to hear Thom Yorke has released his new album via BitTorrent. P2P is exactly what the internet is all about!\u2014 Bob (@wharsmetoothpic) September 26, 2014\n\nYorke isn't the first artist to release something in a BitTorrent bundle, but he's the first to put his album behind a paygate. Since the process is fairly novel, there's even a guide to unlocking the album on BitTorrent's blog. \n\n\"It's an experiment to see if the mechanics of the system are something that the general public can get its head around,\" Yorke wrote of the project.\n\nHowever, based on the reaction of some of the fans, the general public is still a bit confused. First, they need to have a better understanding of BitTorrent. \n\nSo, what is BitTorrent?\n\nBitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that allows users to share files over the Internet. You can \"download files quickly by allowing people downloading the file to upload (distribute) parts of it at the same time,\" according to its own site. \n\nBitTorrent allows people to \"seed\" files -- that is, download files and host them. Instead of downloading your file from a single source, you can \"leech\" pieces of it from multiple seeding sources, which is what makes BitTorrent so much faster than other services. \n\nIt's ideal for sharing large files, and has popularly become a hub for illegally sharing music, movies and more.\n\nOutside of the entertainment world, BitTorrent is also used by companies like Facebook to engineer new updates. \n\nIt was first available in 2001, and has since risen to more than 150 million active users. Peer-to-peer file sharing is extremely popular, though it has seen a decline in recent years because of \"real-time entertainment.\" Streaming services like Netflix have made it easy for fans to get an entertainment fix without downloading whole files.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean peer-to-peer file sharing will disappear. It also hasn't stopped BitTorrent from being more invested in the entertainment realm. \n\nBitTorrent Bundles\n\nIn 2013, the company introduced BitTorrent Bundles. To put it simply, it's essentially a download that includes files like songs and music videos. \n\nArtists such as Madonna, Moby and De La Soul have also released artistic projects through Bundles. It's an interesting model, because it puts the available files behind a gate -- if you want the bundle, you have to exchange your email address, or some other bit of personal information. \n\nThe platform gives artists a certain control over their work. Now, with the paygate, artists will also reap strong financial benefits. They receive 90% of the proceeds, and BitTorrent pockets the remaining 10%.\n\nHow to download files\n\nThere's a helpful guide available on BitTorrent's site, but let's walk through the main points. First, you'll need a torrent file, which you can get from a torrent site. From there, you have to import it into BitTorrent (which you can download here). \n\nHere's how to import, according to BitTorrent's site: \n\nClick File > Add Torrent in BitTorrent (or press CTRL+O) and locate the torrent file.\n\nDouble-click the torrent file. Note: This only works if you've associated .torrent files with BitTorrent -- BitTorrent asks you if it should do this the first time you run it. If you clicked \"No,\" you can do this by going to Options > Preferences in BitTorrent, then clicking \"Associate with .torrent files\" under \"Windows Integration.\"\n\nAdvanced: Click File > Add Torrent from URL in BitTorrent (or press CTRL+U), and enter a URL from which the .torrent file can be obtained.\n\nFrom there, you can search for your desired file on torrent services (here's a list of legal ones compiled by the folks at GigaOM).\n\nTo specifically get Yorke's new album, BitTorrent has another handy step-by-step guide. First, you have to head to the album's Bundle page and click \"Buy the Album.\" You'll be prompted to pay for it, either with a credit card or PayPal. Then you can start the download.\n\nIn order to download Bundles, you must have the BitTorrent client. If you don't have it, you'll be prompted to download the bundle and the client by clicking on the option \"I need the BitTorrent client.\" Heads up: The album can only be downloaded twice.\n\nAfter your download is finished, you can open the files directly or drag them to your media player, like iTunes, Spotify or Windows Media Player. Then you can embrace your inner Yorke and dance frenetically around your room.  \n\nHave something to add to this story?

While the company spent months calling on developers to connect their apps and its data to its hub, HealthKit-enabled apps weren't in the Apple App Store until now. iOS 8 officially launched last Wednesday.\n\nIn fact, the Health app had been sitting empty on iOS 8 users Home screens without much information on what it was and how to use it. Now, users will be able to bring the platform to life by downloading apps that work alongside it.\n\nThe concept is similar to Apple's Passbook app, the iPhone's virtual pocket for things like airline boarding passes, movie tickets and coupons. It can pull in data from other third-party apps such as Nike to keep all your health-related information in one hub.\n\nIn addition to relying on developers to build apps for HealthKit, the company is reportedly working with healthcare providers at Mount Sinai Hospital, the Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins University and electronics health records provider AllScripts, too. \n\nIt announced in June it would be partnering with major organizations like the Mayo Clinic, allowing users to log information like blood pressure within the app. \n\nMore HealthKit-integrated apps are expected to launch in the near future, the report said.\n\nBONUS: Android Apps for Health and Fitness\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Kim, 31, is known to be a heavy smoker, and has gained considerable weight since he came to power in 2011, after the death of his father Kim Jong-il.

However, Mashable was unable to confirm the existence of any photos beyond those showing Kendrick.\n\nSee also: Jennifer Lawrence and Other Celebs Hacked as Nude Photos Circulate on the Web\n\nLinks to the photos were distributed Friday on Reddit and 4chan, the report said. The new list of supposedly leaked photos also includes TV presenter Brooke Burns, Olympic gold medalist Misty May-Treanor, and actresses Briana Evigan, Lauren O\u2019Neil, Alexandra Chando and Kelli Garner. \n\nThe source of the photos showing Kendrick in what appear to be private moments have not yet been confirmed, so it remains unclear whether they are indeed the result of a security breach. Unlike many of the aforementioned leaked photos, none of the photos of Kendrick include nudity or activities that might be considered controversial. \n\nAlthough some photos of Kendrick show her holding a weed pipe and what looks like a marijuana cigarette pressed to her lips, she doesn't actually appear to be smoking. Similarly, in photos of the actress with alcohol, she is either holding an empty bottle or isn't drinking. Also, none of Kendrick's photos appear to be selfies -- a stark difference from the dozens of other hacked photos revealed in recent weeks. \n\nIf the images are confirmed to be a result of a security breach, it may turn out that Kendrick is simply always on guard.

And although there are still other ways cops can get their hands on your iPhone data, authorities are still complaining. \n\n\"It's definitely going to impact investigations, there's no doubt about that,\" Dennis Dragos, a former New York Police Department detective who worked for 11 years in the computer crimes squad, told Mashable. \n\n\"Detectives are trained to follow down every single lead, follow every possible trail until you get to the resolution of your investigation,\" he continued. \"This is now a dead end. You're closing a door that was available before.\"\n\nDragos is not the only one who thinks that way. \n\nOn Thursday, FBI Director James Comey himself said that he was \"very concerned\" about Apple's decision.\n\nJohn Escalante, the chief of detectives for Chicago\u2019s police department, said that because of this change, \"Apple will become the phone of choice for the pedophile.\" \n\nFor some law enforcement officials, this could even become a matter of life and death.  In a Washington Post op-ed, Ronald T. Hosko, the former assistant director at the FBI Criminal Investigative Division, complained that Apple's new privacy stance, later followed by Android, will \"protect many thousands of criminals who seek to do us great harm, physically or financially.\" \n\n\"[Criminals'] phones contain contacts, texts, and geo-tagged data that can help police track down accomplices,\" Hosko wrote. \"These new rules will make it impossible for us to access that information. They will create needless delays that could cost victims their lives.\"\n\nBut privacy advocates and security researchers are skeptical.\n\nIf smartphone encryption prevents the police from solving crimes, how did they solve them before smartphones were invented? Anyone remember?\u2014 matt blaze (@mattblaze) September 23, 2014\n\n\"I think there's a lot of kicking and screaming over this but cops have been able to do their job just fine for the past 200 years in this country, without having access to people's personal iPhone,\" Jonathan Zdiarski, a forensic and security researcher who has worked as a consultant to police agencies, told Mashable. \"Criminals are just as stupid today as they always have been and they're going to leave traces and evidence in a number of places.\"\n\nMoreover, despite all the controversy, there are actually still a few ways for the police to get at least some data from an iPhone with iOS 8 and protected by a passcode. Below, we've broken down some of the ways cops can still put their hands on your digital belongings.\n\nGetting your iCloud backup\n\nIf police officers can't get the data that's locally stored on an iPhone, they might still be able to get it from the cloud. \n\nApple prompts users to back up their iDevices to iCloud, and the data there can be obtained by law enforcement agents with a search warrant. Yes, iCloud backups are encrypted, but they're encrypted with a key in Apple's possession, so Apple can be legally required to turn the backups over if served with a valid legal request, as Micah Lee, First Look's technologist and security expert, explained. \n\nWith iCloud, police can potentially get any data from your phone, unless you turn off the automatic backup, or you only backup certain data.\n\n.@kashhill @craigtimberg Apple knows most will use iCloud. Real privacy preserving move would be to also encrypt backups ala @SpiderOak\u2014 ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) September 18, 2014\n\nUsing forensic tools\n\nForensic tools are still a great way to get some data out of your iPhone. If the police arrests you and gets both your phone and a computer that you used to connect with your phone using iTunes -- a \"paired device\" -- they can dump some data out of it bypassing your passcode using existing forensic tools, as Zdiarski noted in a recent blog post. \n\nIn this case, the passcode doesn't protect you, because Apple has designed this system to allow you to access some data on your phone using iTunes or Xcode without unlocking your device.\n\nThe caveat here is that only some data is available in this scenario. In particular, any data from third party applications such as Facebook, Twitter and Evernote; photos, videos and recordings; and iTunes media such as books and podcasts. But data from native iOS applications like iMessages, emails or calls is out of reach.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, as Zdiarski notes, then you can \"pair lock\" your iPhone so that it doesn't pair with any new computer, preventing police computers from \"pairing\" with your iPhone.\n\nFor the paranoid: A great way to secure your iPhone http://t.co/D2Xv60i9Kt via @JZdziarski\u2014 Blaz Kristan (@blazoncek) September 24, 2014\n\nWithout the ability to impersonate a trusted computer, and with a locked phone protected with the passcode, \"law enforcement at this point doesn't seem to really have any options,\" Zdiarski said.\n\nGetting your iTunes backup\n\nAnother target for police officers is the iTunes backup on your computer. If you back up your iPhone to your computer with iTunes, a police officer that gets his hands on your computer can get all the data that you have last backed up. \n\n\"Data is still available, as long as iTunes and iCloud reign,\" Lee Reiber, the vice president for mobile solutions at forensic firm AccessData, told Mashable.\n\nIn this scenario, only a backup password can stop the police, and in that case, it better be a good password or it might be vulnerable to brute forcing -- the automated process of guessing all possible passwords until you get the right one. Or, they might just force you to give it up.\n\nForcing you to give up your passcode\n\nHaving a passcode protect your phone is great -- unless someone else knows that passcode. And here's a legal caveat many might not be aware of: the police might be able to compel you to give up your passcode, which renders any sophisticated technological protections you might have on your phone completely moot.\n\nThe case law on this issue is still contradictory, and it has only dealt with computers (though it's hard to see the difference between an encrypted computer and an encrypted phone). But in some cases someone who refuses to give up her password can be held in contempt of court, which can even lead to jail, as reported by Wired.\n\nAccording to U.S. law, a defendant can plead the fifth and refuse to testify against himself and self-incriminate. Some think that handing out a password to authorities amounts to self-incrimination and should not be accepted, but others disagree. \n\nBreaking TouchID\n\nWhere there seems to be more consensus that \"pleading the Fifth\" won't get you anywhere is if the cops ask for your fingerprint. \n\nFingerprints, and other physical objects like actual keys, have traditionally not been considered protected by the Fifth Amendment. So if you lock your iPhone with TouchID, the cops can legally compel you to unlock it, as Internet and privacy lawyer Marcia Hoffman explained last year. \n\nAnd if you refuse, police officers might be able to lift your fingerprint from a surface -- say your computer screen -- and unlock it themselves.\n\nAs the video below shows, it's possible to break into an iPhone 6 with a dummy fingerprint just as it was with the 5S.\n\nOther options\n\nOutside of these scenarios, options for law enforcement, at this point, are limited. A good old brute force attack, where you guess every possible passcode combination is technically possible, but there are no forensic tools that can make this automated, both Zdiarski and Reiber said. \n\nTechnically, Apple could brute force a four digit passcode if the police asked the company to do it, but it seems unlikely that Apple would do something like that after trumpeting that they wouldn't help police unlock phones anymore. \n\nDoing it manually is obviously a daunting task, as there are 10,000 combinations of 4 digit passcodes, and iPhones disable after six wrong attempts. \n\nPoor law enforcement. They're going to have to make do with their ability to covertly track you, wiretap you and hack into your computer.\u2014 Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) September 23, 2014\n\nAnd if police are simply looking for call records, they can always request them from phone carriers, or perhaps plant malware on your phone. \n\nAs for the iPhone, it might be harder now, but forensic firms and law enforcement hackers will now look for new places and holes to get data.\n\n\"As secure as the device can be, there's always going to be some vulnerability that can be located and exploited,\" Reiber said. \"That's what it really is, cat and mouse.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

There's the \"physical world,\" as he calls it over and over, and then there's the \"digital world.\"\n\nIn the physical world, there are millions of busy people who frequently scribble ideas on tiny, colorful three-by-three inch papers and then use the gentle adhesive on the back to stick those papers on bulletin boards, refrigerators, desktop computers and other physical objects. They collaborate with coworkers, leave reminders for their children, pass sweet and not-so-sweet notes to their spouses. In the physical world, Post-it Notes are everywhere. In the digital world, they're not.\n\nSee also: Google Glass is Getting a Second Look from Businesses\n\nAs VP and general manager of the stationery and office supplies division at 3M, Kim oversees two of the world's great analog brands: Scotch tape and Post-it Notes. Kim believes in the power and effectiveness of building physical products for consumers and businesses who operate in the physical world. He believes in finding more \"smart uses\" for paper for creativity and collaboration. \n\n\"We've had a really strong track record of continuing to introduce physical products,\" Kim said in a phone interview from 3M's headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, far from the digital upstarts on either coast. \"While I wouldn\u2019t say the digital world wasn\u2019t something that we didn\u2019t look at, there's still a lot of runway for physical products.\"\n\nAbout a year ago, though, Kim and his team started hearing that customers wanted something more than analog. They wanted the ability to take their notes and \"quickly bring that into the digital world.\" Five years after the launch of the original iPhone, the company decided it finally needed a Post-it app.\n\nAround that time, 3M decided to partner with Evernote, a hugely popular note-taking app, on a new feature called the \"Post-it Note Camera,\" which promised to let users photograph and digitize their sticky notes. Clearly that wasn't enough, however. The Post-it team began developing a standalone application under the Post-it brand.\n\nOn Thursday, 3M unveiled the Post-it Plus for iPhone. It essentially does more of the same: you can digitize your analog notes, organize them into boards and then share them with others. What you can't do is create a digital note from scratch. The app is intended to extend the offline note-taking and collaboration process online, not the other way around.\n\n\"It's a good idea that is consistent with the brand, but several years too late,\" says James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester and author of Digital Disruption.\n\nIf you search for \"Post-it\" in Apple's App Store, you'll find more than a dozen note taking apps that appear to be inspired (to put it mildly) by the design of the iconic paper Post-it note. Then there are note-taking apps like Evernote, a startup with a billion-plus dollar valuation, whose founder has said \"the Post-it is something we aspire to be.\" Apple, Google and Microsoft each have their own versions as well. \n\nWhen asked why Post-it didn't embrace mobile sooner (it did have a desktop app) and use its brand power to become the go-to note-taking app, Kim suggested the company was more focused on the use cases and needs of its existing customers.\n\n\"While it may seem obvious that a manufacturer of physical notes would simply create a digital version of the same experience, we heard instead that consumers needed a way to continue working with their favorite tools while helping them transition to the digital world in which their teams work every day,\" Kim said. \n\nMike Vale, executive VP of 3M's consumer retail business, laid out the need for 3M to build up its digital presence during an investor event late last year. \n\n\"When you look at a brand like Post-it that has been here for 30 to 40 years and the evolution of what\u2019s going on in the office market space and the generational change is occurring, we're focused now and we push to continue to make Post-it more relevant to the new millennial generation that is coming into the workforce now,\" Vale said at the time. Part of that effort, he added, would entail \"moving on to different habits that these new consumers are coming into play, so here you see an example of Post-it becoming more relevant to the increasingly digital tablets within the workplace.\"\n\nTo that end, Kim stressed that the Post-it Plus app wouldn't be the brand's only effort to go digital. \"I really look at what we've introduced yesterday as just the start of where the Post-it brand can be taken in the digital world,\" he said. \"It's certainly is going to be a core part of the post it brand strategy moving forward.\"\n\nMcQuivey argues that it's probably \"not so important\" for the long-term survival of 3M, a company whose sales climbed to nearly $30 billion last year, to make the Post-it brand go digital.

Currently, he had said, guards do not carry weapons and must rely on talking with the inmates to quell disturbances.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers in Tennessee have said that's not enough. They want the state to reopen a facility closed in 2012, Taft Youth Development Center, which primarily housed older, more violent offenders. They say the inmates at Taft were transferred to Woodland Hills, which then saw a spike in assaults.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

It found that the iPhone 6 Plus isn't nearly as malleable as some videos make it seem.\n\nConsumer Reports used a \"three-point flexural test\" on the iPhone 6 Plus, in which the phone is gripped by a machine at either end and force is applied to the top. (Apple invited CNBC inside its testing facility after bending phone complaints began surfacing, and it apparently uses the same test.)\n\nSee also: The Apple iPhone 6 Plus 'BendGate' Is Already Out of Control\n\nAlong with the iPhone 6 Plus, Consumer Reports conducted the same tests on the iPhone 6, the iPhone 5, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the LG G3 and an HTC One M8. It found that it took 90 pounds of force to begin to deform the iPhone 6 Plus case, and 110 pounds of pressure to make the screen come off.\n\nWhile Consumer Reports didn't offer much context as to what those numbers meant, it did say that 55 pounds of pressure, which is what Apple apparently uses to test its phones, was enough to snap three pencils.\n\nSurprisingly, the iPhone 6 Plus actually outperformed the iPhone 6 during testing, which bent at 70 pounds of pressure and had the screen come off at 100. \n\nThe strongest phone was the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which bent and lost its screen at 150 pounds of pressure. Just behind that was the sturdy iPhone 5, bending at 130 pounds of pressure. \n\nThe phone that performed the worst was the HTC One M8, which, like the iPhone 6, bent at 70 pounds of pressure, and lost its screen at 90, though it's worth nothing that this seems like a large amount of pressure to apply to any phone. \n\nApple commented earlier this week, saying bends in the 6 Plus were 'extremely rare.' \n\n\"With normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.

Last year\u2019s model is still one of my favorite Android phones. Motorola really struck gold with the design, which felt just right in one hand even though it had a relatively large 4.7-inch screen. It was light, pretty and it did some things no other phone could, such as always listening for your voice to wake it up.\n\nThe new Moto X ($99.99 with a two-year contract from AT&T or Verizon, $499.99 unlocked) carries over many of those same ideas, but the execution just isn\u2019t as good. The screen is larger at 5.2 inches, which makes it nice and big, but it\u2019s also harder to use with one hand. It added leather as a design choice for the customizable back, but it creases easily. And parts of the experience -- the camera UI in particular -- aren't fully thought through.\n\nSee also: Moto 360 Smartwatch Is Gorgeous, But Wait for Version 2\n\nAt least Motorola gets a lot of the hardware design right. The curved back and edged-off sides make the phone a bit easier to grip than, say, the iPhone 6, and the aluminum frame conveys a good build quality. Moto also took the opportunity to put some real speakers in this thing -- highlighted by the thin design ornaments above and below the display. And they can play LOUD, comparable to the HTC One M8.\n\nThe new Moto X also once again lets you take advantage of Moto Maker, the web app that customizes the look of your phone before you buy. It's a nice perk, and the company even added leather to the mix this time. After occupying my pocket (along with keys and a wallet) for a couple of weeks, however, a leather-backed phone gets marked-up pretty easily.\n\nFor the 2014 Moto X, Motorola bumped up its specs to flagship-level with a 1,920 x 1,080 AMOLED display, 2GB of RAM and the ability to shoot 4K video. The chip is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 with a separate quad-core graphics processor. It runs Android 4.4.4 KitKat, includes dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and is compatible with Bluetooth 4.0 (AKA Bluetooth Smart) products. You can buy devices with better specs, but this is a powerful phone.\n\nThe (lack of) power of X\n\nIt's perhaps too powerful. If there\u2019s a major complaint I have about the Moto X, it\u2019s the battery. At 2,300 milliamp-hours (just slightly bigger than last year's model), it barely gets through a day of normal use, and if you go anything beyond that, you\u2019ll be down to fumes by 6 p.m. I would have preferred a slightly heftier phone with a battery I can actually rely on instead of a 5-ounce device that craps out well before it should.\n\nAt least it's putting the energy to (mostly) good use. One of the things the Moto X has always gotten right is convenience: Thanks to a low-power core in the processor, it's always listening for a passphrase that you can use to unlock the phone and get information without even needing to pick up the phone.\n\nLast year the phone was limited to the vanilla phrase, \"OK, Google Now,\" but now you can customize it to something more personal. There are limits -- go too long or too short and you'll have to redo it -- but that still gives you a lot to work with. I indulged my inner Trekkie with the phrase, \"Kirk to Enterprise.\"\n\nMotorola also added more context-based actions this time around, like being able to activate the screen by holding your hand up to it, and the ability to dismiss calls by waving your hand over the display. Very nice, although those may be part of the reason the battery winds down so quickly.\n\nThe Moto X has a technically sophisticated camera. It shoots excellent 13-megapixel photos, and it has lots of bells and whistles, including a burst mode, slow-motion video and a \u201cring\u201d flash that uses a pair of bright LEDs.\n\nUnfortunately, Motorola offers up a relatively lousy user interface. It\u2019s very simple, but it\u2019s actually too stripped down. It\u2019s not obvious where your settings are, which icons do what, or how to change some of them. I actually never figured out how to turn off the \u201ctap anywhere to capture\u201d setting, which I personally found annoying.\n\nI also don't care for the gesture-based navigation. Slide your finger in from the left and you find settings; slide in from the right and you go to your Gallery. The problem with the latter is that if you try it while in landscape mode you'll instead launch Google Now, since that's also gesture-activated from the same place. It's all supposed to make moving around easier, but it instead does the opposite.\n\nWatch me\n\nOne of the things the Moto X does extremely well is work with the Moto 360 smartwatch (shocker). Although the watch works with other phones, only a Motorola phone can download and use the Moto Connect app. There's not much there -- just watch faces and a \"wellness profile\" -- so I have no idea why there even is a separate app, but at least you can get the full experience.\n\nMotorola likes to take pride in giving users a \"pure\" Android experience, meaning they don't do much in the way of skinning or pre-loading useless apps, which is somewhat true. However, it can't stop AT&T and Verizon from loading up your phone with tons of junk. Only Apple, it seems, has access to the get-out-of-bloatware-free card.\n\nIn design, overall power and convenience, the Moto X is a step forward. Its feeble battery, unfortunately, moves it two steps back. Even putting that aside, the Moto X may not be as dull or as poorly thought through as the Samsung Galaxy S5, but it\u2019s also not as well-made as the HTC One M8 or as just plain gorgeous as the LG G3.\n\nIn short, you can do better.\n\nMoto X (2014)\n          The GoodPretty design \u2022 Powerful specs \u2022 Improved voice controlThe BadInadequate battery \u2022 Too large to operate comfortably with one handThe Bottom LineDesigned more for the market than for users, the 2014 Moto X is a step up from the original in many ways, but its large screen and poor battery life make it less usable.\n          \n\nHave something to add to this story?

As Jones reaches back into his vehicle, Goubert opens fire with a handgun. \n\nJones was struck at least once, in the hip, and can be heard repeating \"I just grabbed my license, you said get my license,\" and, \"What did I do, sir?\" \n\nOn the same day, the New York Daily News published a video of a visibly pregnant woman allegedly being thrown to the ground, belly-first, by a New York Police Department officer in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The NYPD internal affairs division has opened an investigation into the incident. \n\n (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\r\nPost by El Grito De Sunset Park.\n\nA similar scene was shown in a video from the same Brooklyn neighborhood earlier this month when a police officer was caught kicking a street vendor who resisted arrest. The officer was later stripped of his badge, and the situation is still under investigation.\n\nYet another video showing a violent altercation with police went viral in late August. The video, titled \"Black man tazed and taken to jail for sitting,\" has garnered more than a million views since it was uploaded to YouTube on Aug. 26. It shows Chris Lollie, a father of four from Minnesota, being arrested and tased while waiting to pick his children up from daycare. The Police-Civilian Internal Affairs Review Commission is now investigating the case, and Lollie has said he plans to launch a federal civil rights lawsuit. \n\nThough the videos have drawn attention to the issue of excessive force in arrests, they do not always lead to prosecution. On Aug. 5, 22-year-old John Crawford III was killed by police in a Walmart while carrying an air rifle (also known as a BB gun) sold in the store. The incident was caught on tape. \n\nA grand jury decided Wednesday after reviewing the video that the shooting was justified, and no officers involved would be indicted. \n\nCrawford's family said in a statement they are \"disgusted\" by the decision. \n\n\"The Walmart surveillance video and eyewitnesses prove that the killing of John H. Crawford, lll was not justified and was not reasonable,\" they said.\n\nIn some cases, however, the public outcry caused by the videos has led to investigation and prosecution of police officers. One woman whose brutal beating by a California Highway Patrol officer was caught on tape will receive a $1.5 million settlement, the state agency announced Wednesday.\n\nBut in Ferguson, where the unarmed teen Michael Brown was shot by Darren Wilson, a police officer, there was no video to help determine what happened and whether excessive force was used. A grand jury is currently considering whether to bring charges against Wilson. The FBI is independently investigating the incident to determine whether Brown's civil rights were violated.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Another seven people were missing.\n\nThe injured were in mountain lodges, because they were unable to descend 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake on their own, said Sohei Hanamura, a crisis management official in Nagano prefecture. Thirty-two people had serious injuries, including at least seven who lost consciousness.\n\nSee also: 'Swarm' of Volcanic Eruptions Could Help Mask Global Warming\n\nPolice, fire and military rescue workers were trying to approach the area on foot, after deciding that the ash in the air made it too dangerous to use helicopters. The ash was also hampering their ascent.\n\nLocal fire department confirms woman killed in #Ontake volcano eruption \u6728\u66fd\u5e83\u57df\u6d88\u9632\u672c\u90e8 \u5fa1\u5dbd\u5c71\u5674\u706b \u5973\u6027\uff11\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1 http://t.co/lJlJck2MxH pic.twitter.com/pDUZcDAth6\u2014 Thoton News Japan (@Thoton) September 27, 2014\n\nHanamura said seven people were reported missing on the mountain.\n\nLodge managers were familiar with first aid procedures and were communicating with rescue officials in town, he said.\n\nWith a sound likened to thunder, the volcano erupted shortly before noon on a clear autumn day, spewing large white plumes of ash high into the sky and sending people on the mountainside fleeing.\n\nThe eruption continued into the night, blanketing the surrounding area in ash. About 250 people were initially trapped on the slopes, but most had made their way down by Saturday night, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Some were in shelters set up in four nearby towns.\n\nOne witness told NHK that the eruption started with large booms that sounded like thunder.\n\nIn a YouTube video, shocked climbers can be seen moving quickly away from the peak as an expanding plume of ash emerges above and then engulfs them.\n\nMany of those who made it down emerged with clothes and backpacks covered in ash. They reported being engulfed in total darkness for several minutes.\n\nMikio Oguro, an NHK journalist who was on the slope on an unrelated assignment, told the station that he saw massive smoke coming out of the crater, blocking sunlight and reducing visibility to zero.\n\n\"Massive ash suddenly fell and the entire area was totally covered with ash,\" he said by phone. He and his crew had to use headlamps to find a lodge.\n\n\"My colleagues later told me that they thought they might die,\" Oguro said.\n\nTwo Jetstar flights headed to Tokyo's Narita International Airport diverted to Kansai International Airport in western Japan as a precaution.\n\nJapan's meteorological agency raised the alert level for Mount Ontake to 3 on a scale of 1 to 5. It warned people to stay away from the mountain, saying ash and other debris could fall up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away.\n\nMount Ontake, about 210 kilometers (130 miles) west of Tokyo, sits on the border of Nagano and Gifu prefectures, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. The volcano's last major eruption was in 1979.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
