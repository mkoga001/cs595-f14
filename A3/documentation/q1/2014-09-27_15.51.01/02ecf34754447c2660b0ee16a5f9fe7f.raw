                <p>-Don&#8217;t hit on your friend&#8217;s boyfriends or husbands (duh!)</p>
<p>-Don&#8217;t call your friend&#8217;s boyfriend/husband without asking her first</p>
<p>-If your best male friend is dating, don&#8217;t see him alone or have long conversations about his relationship. See him with his new girlfriend and try to befriend her too. No dinners behind her back.</p>
<p>-Just because he is your male friend, don&#8217;t defend him if he treats his girlfriend poorly or lies and cheats on her. Remember it can happen to you too..</p>
<p>-If your girlfriend complains about her boyfriend, listen but don&#8217;t butt in. If they stay together you will pay the price if you tell her to leave him.</p>
<p>-Never be a married man&#8217;s confidante. Tell him to find a therapist.</p>
<p>-Avoid emotional cheating by being civil but not too close to married men at work.</p>
<p>-If you hear that your girlfriend&#8217;s boyfriend or husband is cheating, or if he hits on you, tell her. You may lose her friendship but you will help her get rid of an asshole.</p>
<p>-Don&#8217;t tell your girlfriend&#8217;s boyfriend or husband her secrets or anything that can make her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same can be applied to men.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/slut-shaming-vs-class/">Slut shaming vs&nbsp;Class</a></h2>

                <p>There is a lot of shaming in shaming nowadays. The era of political correctedness became &#8220;you can&#8217;t shame this, you can&#8217;t shame that&#8221;. Fat shaming, gay shaming, slut shaming, etc. I want to discuss slut shaming. What men or women do with their bodies and how they lead their sexual lives is nobody&#8217;s business, really. When women dress sexy, men should be able to control themselves and not see that as a sign these women are up for grabs (pun intended).</p>
<p><a href="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/urach.jpg"><img id="i-2404" class="size-full wp-image" src="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/urach.jpg?w=650" alt="Image" /></a></p>
<p>However, as the mother of two females, I see with sadness some behavior in young women that isn&#8217;t very attractive. And it reeks of desperation. Looking at Brazil, for example, or American reality TV, I see some women who will do anything to embarrass or devalue themselves. And that has little to do with how they dress. If there is one thing I think is still attractive in people, it is class. Good manners, respect. Sometimes women sell themselves short or think that sexuality alone will take them places, land them a rich or famous boyfriend or make themselves famous. That kind of fame is fleeting. The kind of men they will attract is not the desirable kind. Sexy and attractive young women are a dime a dozen in this planet, especially with all the body enhancements available. A Brazilian starlet (see picture above) humiliated herself for Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, planting herself in front of his hotel during the football World Cup in Brazil and following him around after saying she had had an affair with him. Another Brazilian uses nudity to become a famous piano player.</p>
<p>There is nothing less attractive than an over made-up woman who opens her mouth and talks trash&#8230;.no education, culture or information. Intelligence is sexy, and class is just another name for self-respect.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/are-brazilians-happier/">Are Brazilians happier?</a></h2>

                <p><a href="https://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/brasil.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2396" src="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/brasil.jpg?w=300&#038;h=214" alt="Brasil" width="300" height="214" /></a>&#8220;In Brazil. My people. Money or no money. Still happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a comment made by a Brazilian, in broken English, when asked what he missed about Brazil. We hear a lot that even poor Brazilians, sometimes living in slum-like environment, seem happy. What is the reason for that? Brazilians put friends, family and celebrations ahead of possesions. True, Brazilians love an iPhone and a flat screen TV or even a nice imported car. But there are other things that make them happy: football (soccer), churrasco with friends (barbecue), beach (free), cold beer (cheap), open channels on TV (free), nature (free). This capacity to be joyful and playful even in the face of bad living conditions, long lines for healthcare, packed public transportation, low minimum wages and high criminality in big cities is inherent to a population that doesn&#8217;t take life (or work) too seriously.  Here are some reasons that may make Brazilians happier than other nationalities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)      Warm engaging personalities, curiosity. Brazilians are usually extroverts and like to talk to everyone, even strangers. Brazilians are people-people. They like to live in dense population areas because they like to be around people. Brazilians are not fond of living too isolated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)      Brazilians don&#8217;t take religion too seriously. Even if they call themselves Catholic, they don&#8217;t frequent church with assiduity and don&#8217;t let religious doctrines run their lives, prejudice and all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)      Brazilians are more open to sexuality. There is less guilt about revealing clothes or showing the human body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4)       Tighter family ties. It is more common than in developed countries for families to live in the same city and see each other frequently. There is overall less loneliness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5)      Brazilians love romance. People don&#8217;t stay single long, or live without relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6)      Brazilians work hard despite their fame of being party people, but they do not let work be their everything. Making a lot of money is not as important as survival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7)      Brazilians take vacations, 20 to 30 days a year. That says a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8)      Brazilians love to celebrate carnaval, soccer games, weddings, etc. Social life is important. That is good for mental health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walking in the streets of Rio or any other city in Brazil, you see happy people. Are they really happy? Isn&#8217;t there depression and sadness? Of course. But it is a general impression that people are slightly happier than in other places, even if it is just stereotyping.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2014/05/17/the-reasons-for-barbara-walters-success/">The reasons for Barbara Walters&#8217;&nbsp;Success</a></h2>

                <p>The Barbara Walters special on her career was a great ride through history. Amazing life. I would have loved to have had her life. She is, after all, the most fascinating person. I tried to analize the reason of her success and it is, in my humble opinion:</p>
<p>1) She speaks calmly, softly, clearly and intelligently. She never loses her cool (despite the nasal voice).</p>
<p>2) She worked hard, long hours (no wonder she neglected her adopted daughter who greatly resents her).</p>
<p>3) She was not a beauty, but she adopted a classic style and made the most of her looks.</p>
<p>4) She prepared extensively for every interview, getting to know the interviewee better than himself/herself.</p>
<p>5) She famously developed a list of questions that she would spend days on. The questions were thought provoking and dug deep into these people&#8217;s personal lives, making them cry and bringing viewership. The order these questions were asked were important for building momentum.</p>
<p>6) She made her interviewees feel comfortable and open up because she demonstrated respect, care, wisdom, class (even if it was fake). She became Ms. Respectability.</p>
<p>7) The woman who had problems in doing anything practical, like cooking or driving a car, had a knack for what makes people tick. And knew how to kiss asses and network.</p>
<p>8) She loved what she did, and still does. Even though she is retiring from &#8220;The View&#8221;, she is going to continue being its Executive Producer even though she&#8217;s 85. When you love what you do, you never want to stop doing it. Lucky few love what they do. Yes, I would have loved to have her life.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/why-dating-in-your-50s-is-better-than-your-40s/">Why dating in your 50&#8217;s is better than in your&nbsp;40&#8217;s</a></h2>

                <p><a href="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/older-couple2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2384" src="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/older-couple2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="older couple2" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>A lot of first marriages break when people reach 40, unfortunately. In your late 30&#8217;s and early 40&#8217;s most people who were married in their 20&#8217;s and early to mid-30&#8217;s have children. There are many family obligations when your cuhildren are dependent on you. You still interact with your ex, and sometimes that is a source of conflict for the new boyfriend or girlfriend.</p>
<p>Merging familes is not a piece of cake. It is much easier when one of you do not have children and are willing to become a step-parent figure; as long as you don&#8217;t demand exclusive attention from your partner. If both have children, it is easier to understand the demands that parenthood entails. It is easier to arrange your routine around the children. However, it can also create a whole slew of problems, namely because you are trying to integrate two families with different values and habits into one. There is also interference from the other parent. No easy task, and I don&#8217;t envy couples in that situation.</p>
<p>When you become single in your 50&#8217;s though, a lot of the complications with children are generally gone. They may still be in College, but they are not dependent on their parents on a daily basis anymore. That is a great phase for dating again: you both have time, freedom to travel when you wish and lot&#8217;s of energy-you are still young. I see the greatest harmony in couples that age.</p>
<p>Finally, the maturity they have achieved make the petty stuff not so important; jealousy is not so much an element any longer, a sense of calm and understanding prevails, a sense of &#8220;we don&#8217;t have that many decades ahead so let&#8217;s make the best of life&#8221;, a sense of accomplishment, may it be professional or having successfully raised your children, an interest in causes and other bigger things than worries about money and kids, less need to impress, more personal confidence, less attachment to material things and less sexual addiction-relationships are more based in common interests and companionship than lust. Hopefully, 50 plus folks get to find someone who they want to spend their old age with, since being single and isolated in your later years is one of the biggest  causes of early death.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/dinks/">DINKS</a></h2>

                <p><em><strong>What are dinks? That is how you call couples who have double incomes, no kids. Obviously childless couples that make a choice not to have children fit into that category, but I want to discuss the ones who are now empty nesters and middle aged. If you happen to have a good marriage and your kids are grown, living on their own and financially independent, you can have the best of lives. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>When does middle age start and end? Somewhere from 45 to 65.  Some say middle age starts at 40, some say at 50. Anyhow, since we are all living longer and looking a lot better at 50, I think that age group has been pushed forward. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>This phase of your life can be the best in many ways. Your health should be good, provided you take care of it. Your finances are usually more secure, provided you have not been a victim of the job loss and economic upheaval of the 2008 recession former President Bush left us with. Having two incomes, sharing a house and not having any financial or time obligations with your kids does allow you to travel more, invest more, remodel more, enjoy hobbies, eat better, exercise more&#8230;the list of benefits is long. Not everyone though is lucky to  have a companion at this phase of their lives, especially with the high divorce rate. And some people do very well on their own, financially and emotionally. For people like myself though, for whom having a loving relationship rates as a priority, being part of a DINK is just the ideal situation to be.</strong> </em></p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/2344/">Women in the Middle&nbsp;East</a></h2>

                <p><a href="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/library.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2350" alt="library" src="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/library.jpg?w=296&#038;h=300" width="296" height="300" /></a>An interesting experience to share:  see the meme on the left about women in Saudi Arabia not being able to go to a library alone? Well, I had the chance of listening to a Muslim woman in a party I went to last Friday. This woman said that even though we see Muslim women as victims of oppressive men, THEY are the ones who want to maintain the status quo, in particular the ones from rich families. The system that keeps women from enjoying the freedom that we have here also &#8220;protects&#8221; them in her view. They don&#8217;t have to work and they sometimes have a beautiful home and everything material they need. They like to take care of their husbands because they are the providers. They are scared of being homeless, live in poverty or become single mothers. So they like their golden cage.</p>
<p>Which makes me think that women have not yet found power, and never will until they have money. Money rules. A woman who can support herself and well doesn&#8217;t need to subjugate to anyone. There are many who have achieved this in the western world, but overall women continue to have the simplest positions and the lowest paying jobs. Therefore, they turn to men to save them. We all know that a man can be fat, old and bald that he can still find a younger woman who is attractive as long as she sees him as a good provider. Money has an interesting way to create &#8220;love&#8221;. Obviously, she will move on to a better provider if she has the chance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a vicious circle. Education is the route to financial independence; so it entrepreneurship. Many women feel they can&#8217;t compete so they lag behind. A man is the only way to feel safe and secure, especially when children are involved. That is one of the reasons women stay in bad relationships and &#8220;fall in love&#8221; for men with money. In third world countries that is very common. So I was presented with this other angle of the &#8220;poor Middle Eastern oppressed women&#8221;. This lady also said the mothers raise their own sons that way, to feel more important and more valuable than a woman, and have sisters cater to their brothers since a young age.</p>
<p>I say education is key, but women&#8217;s desire to be protected keeps them from achieving.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/the-crazy-americans/">The Crazy Americans</a></h2>

                <p>A myth that is perpetuated by many Brazilians is that there are many mentally ill people in America compared to other countries. Mental illness is a condition that can affect any human being, anywhere.</p>
<p>America has a higher number of serial killers, although the crime du jour seems to be senseless shootings of as many people as possible. Brazilians like to say that in Brazil there are more crimes of passion while America has more crimes of hate. In reality, there is a lot more crime per capta in Brazil, fueled by money and goods (cell phones, watches, cars..).</p>
<p>When it comes to the urban myth that Americans are crazier than other nationalities -which can encompass from slightly nerdy to violently murderous-here are some possibilities:</p>
<p>1) The nuclear family is less prevalent in America. Many single parents, higher divorce rates, more lonely seniors, more never-married folks.</p>
<p>2) The decentralized cities, the far-out suburbs, higher dependency on individual cars instead of walking and public transportation; less human contact overall.</p>
<p>3) Winter.  Long months of short days, grey skies, uninviting cold temperatures that make people cocoon.  It is well known that people get more depressed in the winter and rainy days.</p>
<p>4) The Protestant work ethic. More work, less play. Long hours, 3 jobs, long commutes. Less time for family, friends and community.</p>
<p>5) A more materialistic society. Acquiring goods only promotes temporary happiness. There are many poor folks in developing countries that claim to be very happy with very little.</p>
<p>6) The gun culture. The &#8220;cowboy and war movie&#8221; culture.  The glorification of violence instead of diplomacy and negotiation.</p>
<p>7) Lifestyle. More processed foods, less fresh fruit and vegetables. Less walking and biking compared to other countries. Low nutrition diets and lack of exercise do not promote mental health.</p>
<p>8) Extreme individuality. The idea that everyone can &#8220;pull themselves through their bootstraps&#8221; makes people not look for help and suffer alone. Selfishness in intimate relationships that makes people never commit because they are waiting for the bigger better deal.</p>
<p>9) The cost of therapy. Mental health was not included in many health plans. Now, under the ACA, it will be. Nevertheless, most people cannot pay their share of the cost. Free services are few and sometimes not quality based, and people do not know where to find it. Clergy do not have the qualifications to help mentally ill people and sometimes only make it worse with religious prejudice.</p>
<p>Here are some staggering statistics about mental health in the US vs the rest of the world (from 2004): <a href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20040601/rate-of-mental-illness-is-staggering" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20040601/rate-of-mental-illness-is-staggering</a></p>

                <h2><a href="http://brasilmagic.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/can-starbucks-fight-against-the-cafezinho/">Can Starbucks fight against the&nbsp;cafezinho?</a></h2>

                <p><a href="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/cafezinho.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2375" alt="Coffee Cup" src="http://brasilmagic.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/cafezinho.jpg?w=300&#038;h=182" width="300" height="182" /></a>I bet Starbucks marketing directors had several meetings to discuss the Latin American strategy. After all, their expansion plan in the land of good coffee might not be as clearly as successful as their American venture. America was the land of bad coffee. Yes, anyone who remembers the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s in the US probably knows how terrible coffee was: a brown semi hot tasteless concoction which resembled tea. In contrast, Brazil is the country of the famous &#8220;cafezinho&#8221;, an espresso-like small cup of very strong coffee, preferably black, 2 teaspoons of sugar.</p>
<p>Starbucks pioneered good coffee grains from exotic tropical countries into America. The coffee was hot, black and fragrant. Lattes became popular. Americans were hooked. Suddenly no one wanted Folgers anymore, no one wanted weak coffee anymore. It became a habit and an addiction. People had no idea how to live without a strong dose of caffeine. Different flavors, milk, soy, almond milk, syrups, coffee from different countries, a cozy place to enjoy a book or work in the laptop.</p>
<p>Brazilians are not used to drinking coffee in paper cups. Brazilians are used to small china cups. You can hardly find &#8220;creamer&#8221; in any Brazilian supermarket. When Brazilians are not drinking black coffee, they drink &#8220;cafe com leite&#8221; (which is half coffee, half milk), usually in the morning.</p>
<p>So what are the chances that Starbucks will be a great success all over Brazil? Good. Brazillians love American labels. Starbucks gives status. Starbucks is a cool coffee shop. However, changing the traditional way of drinking coffee will not happen overnight, nor will it happen in large scale. Price is a consideration. Brazilians do not have the income for Starbucks.  The cafezinho is dirt cheap. I suspect Starbucks will be restricted to the higher income urban Brazilians, the mall dwellers and foreign tourists. Hopefully, Starbucks won&#8217;t suffer the fate of &#8220;Outback Steakhouse&#8221;, which cannot compete with the wonderful Brazilian &#8220;churrascarias&#8221;-Brazilian barbecue/steakhouses.</p>
