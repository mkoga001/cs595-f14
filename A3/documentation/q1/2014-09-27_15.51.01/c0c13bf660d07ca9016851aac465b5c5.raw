One year later, in 2003, Meetup was just passing the 12-month mark when MySpace began its meteoric rise. The company had pulled together two years of connecting people by the time Facebook first appeared on Harvard University students' screens, and, in 2006, Meetup said hello to Twitter (but probably only in 140 characters or less).\n\nThe group-building and networking platform now boasts nearly 20 million members, according to Scott Heiferman, its co-founder and CEO. Approximately half a million events per month flow through its system, all of this managed by about 130 employees. \n\nThe point is, Meetup has survived where others haven't, and it's staked out a space all its own as a major, if somewhat atypical, player in the social-network milieu.\n\n\"Well, we existed before there was this current concept of social media,\" says Heiferman. \"And so, hot things will come and go, but we're going to outlive and outlast them all.\"\n\nSee also: Travel Planning App Gogobot Hand-Picks Which Events to Hit Up \n\nHowever, Meetup's mission is initially not \u2014 as Heiferman puts it \u2014 to overtake platforms such as Facebook, or beat the numbers of whatever metric one usually uses to define success as a business of its type. \n\nWhen it comes to its own future, what's clear is that Meetup has a mission particular to a very personal company vision. Meetup is about change for the better. It's going for a kind of cultural transformation.\n\nThe Humanist agenda: Meetup's metric means community\n\nUnlike the social-media rubric that suggests customers should spend as much time on a platform as possible, when Meetup works as intended the connections you create push you offline. To do what Meetup is designed to help you achieve, you have to walk away from the web and into the real-world \u2014 to go somewhere and interact with people, face to face. \n\nIt's not a phenomenon that Heiferman says worries Meetup's leadership. In fact, it's pretty much the point.\n\n\"It's too simplistic to say that we use the Internet to get people off the Internet,\" he says. \"It's important \u2014 it's essential \u2014 that they meet up offline, but, for us, we're in the business of building real communities. Our mission is that we want a world filled with real local communities.\"\n\nSo, perhaps set aside for a moment whatever concept of Internet-based metrics with which one is familiar \u2014 billions of users, or however many thousands of messages per second \u2014 Meetup is working on something else. Tangible or not, it's a humanist agenda, and it's fueled by what sounds like a sense of optimism about how we interact.\n\nHeiferman describes a Meetup group of moms based in Jersey City. \n\nThey require that their members attend frequently \u2014 they're after connections deeper than a typical list-serve might provide, the way he describes them. And then, when an individual needs something, from extra babysitting to a crib on short notice, the group's members dive into getting those resources into that person's hands.\n\n\"The magic that comes from the connections \u2026 this is really about getting people to collide, and to mesh together, and come together as friends,\" Heiferman says. \n\nSee also: The CEO of Meetup Does Not Have a Desk [VIDEO] \n\n\"The sharing economy is alive and biggest in these communities,\" he continues. \"Intricate, true, emerging communities that may not have existed if Meetup did not exist. That's where you get the hairs on the back of your neck stand up and you say, 'OK, we've got to make this greatest platform, and then we've got to make this better.'\"\n\nNext moves: Getting the offline world to meet \u2026 online\n\nMaking Meetup better, or bigger, or both \u2014 how Heiferman and his team go about doing that might, ironically, require the company to revisit its online iteration. \n\nBut ironic or not, Heiferman isn't kidding. He wants to see Meetup grow beyond 20 million users into something with even larger world-changing potential.\n\n\"The job of making people feel comfortable with other people,\" is one way that Heiferman describes an essential challenge that Meetup faces. Getting them to sign up, find groups, and take the potentially huge step of going to meet strangers for the first time: \"there's a lot to do there,\" he says.\n\nIt can sometimes seem impossible. When Heiferman hears about a meet-up supposed to support (say) cancer survivors in a nearby state, and he learns that there are not enough members joining to sustain that group, he talks about frustration. He says he wants to further bolster the speed and effectiveness with which Meetup's optimistic goals take root.\n\nAnd so, changes are underway. \n\nThe parts that Heiferman will talk about have to do with building out the social-media tools that Meetup members have at their disposal \u2014 adding ways to connect prior to, and then during, the platform's offline group lifecycle. \n\nWhile Meetup offers basic chat functions within its group pages, Heiferman suggests there are more steps to take when it comes to getting people together in the digital space. \n\n\"They meet up, which is amazing,\" he says, \"and they throw comments around, but we have an opportunity to \u2014 in a modern global world and in a modern global way \u2014 enable them to talk to each other online in addition to offline.\"\n\nThe plans aren\u2019t ready for a press release, yet, however. \n\n\"I can't reveal too much more than that,\" says Heiferman, \"because it's hinting too much at what's around the corner. But it's going to be a really big year for us.\"\n\nNo matter what the next move, 12 years into its quest for new ways to amplify human connections, Meetup has already got perseverance in its portfolio. Now, it just needs its community to catch up with the platform-makers' goals.\n\n\"To your point about longevity, look, the impossible takes a while,\" Heiferman says. \"We're doing something hard. We're trying to change culture, and that takes a while.\""},"shares":{"twitter":904,"facebook":197,"google_plus":16,"linked_in":72,"pinterest":1,"total":1190},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzE3L2IzL01lZXR1cC4xMGFhZS5wbmcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/fbc69c20/ab8/Meetup.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzE3L2IzL01lZXR1cC4xMGFhZS5wbmcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNzV4MTc1IwplCWpwZw/c79653ee/ab8/Meetup.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzE3L2IzL01lZXR1cC4xMGFhZS5wbmcKcAl0aHVtYgkzNTB4MzUwIwplCWpwZw/960151c6/ab8/Meetup.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzE3L2IzL01lZXR1cC4xMGFhZS5wbmcKcAl0aHVtYgk4MHg4MCMKZQlqcGc/49fda626/ab8/Meetup.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzE3L2IzL01lZXR1cC4xMGFhZS5wbmcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNjB4MTYwIwplCWpwZw/1efa5a32/ab8/Meetup.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1BLLPk6","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"gogobot-activities"},{"data-slug":"scott-heiferman-meetup-video"}]},"excerpt":"Meetup has survived where others haven't, and it's staked out a space all its own as a major, if somewhat atypical, player in the social-network milieu.","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Social Media","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/social-media/"},{"_id":"540f30c512d2cd282e002b1c","id":"2014/09/09/apple-live-hub-social","title":"Apple Finally Gets Social With Its Own 'Live Hub' for iPhone Event","title_tag":null,"author":"Christina Warren","post_date":"2014-09-09T16:54:20+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 09 Sep 2014 16:54:20 +0000","sort_key":"1xrpjN","link":"http://mashable.com/2014/09/09/apple-live-hub-social/","content":{"plain":"Want more proof that Tuesday's Apple event is a big deal?

Vine allows a combination of outside videos and footage shot in-app, so really, it opens up doors to collaboration and more creativity.\n\nSee also: Hands On With the New Vine: 6-Second Videos Will Never Be the Same\n\nYou can also duplicate frames and mute the sound in individual clips, as well as preview every shot while still in shooting mode. And some of the best features happen to be things we didn't expect to see: a torch for lighting up dark rooms, a level to balance your shot, and focus lock and ghost mode on the front camera.\n\nFor this week's Mashable Vine Challenge, we're asking readers to use some (or all) of these new features to create cool six-second videos.\n\nWe played around with video import, the level and torch, and frame duplicating for our own example.

(\"Fap\" is a word for masturbation commonly used on Reddit.) As new photos were released, a live post provided updates, and a leaked photo archive compiled the photos.\n\nThe live thread has since been banned; the archive post is \"no longer available due to a copyright claim.\"\n\nLeaked photos are being removed from imgur and other hosting services as quickly as possible -- but not fast enough. The mod post attatched to the top of the subreddit lists over 50 \"whitelisted\" image hosting domains.\n\nIf you're casually browsing Reddit, you won't notice any threads from TheFappening; it was removed from the main page, r/all, per the suggestion of the subreddit's admins. Still, according to user johnsmcjohn, a moderator for TheFappening, the subreddit has seen 12,187,720 unique visitors in 3 days.\n\nAccording to one anonymous post discussing a 4chan thread, a celebrity porn exchange ring has been going on for years. One redditor even points out that dicussions on anon-ib have been surrounding stolen celebrity photos \"more or less dedicated to ripping iCloud accounts.\"\n\nRegardless of the origins of the pictures, the fact that the donations were returned appears to have been a sobering moment for at least one Redditor:\r\nReddit responds to having its sticky money rejected by the Prostate Cancer Foundation: pic.twitter.com/tmvI1QUPJV\n\n\u2014 Neetzan Zimmerman (@neetzan) September 2, 2014\n\n[H/T: The Daily Dot]"},"shares":{"facebook":151,"twitter":1038,"linked_in":57,"google_plus":68,"pinterest":1,"total":1315},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzAzL2E5L01vbmV5LmYxYzlkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/0167486f/a2d/Money.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzAzL2E5L01vbmV5LmYxYzlkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/58b539ce/a2d/Money.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzAzL2E5L01vbmV5LmYxYzlkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/fef57ebd/a2d/Money.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzAzL2E5L01vbmV5LmYxYzlkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/6bbded71/a2d/Money.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzAzL2E5L01vbmV5LmYxYzlkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/7cf9f1e7/a2d/Money.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1lGCLcA","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"fbi-celebrity-photo-hack"}]},"velocity":[991,994,995,997,999,999,999,998,996,993,1000,995,981,977,973,964,960,956,951,946,941,935,919,913,906,899,892,885,877,869,861,852,844,835,826,818,809,801,792,784,776,768,751,744,727,720,712,705,698,691],"show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Social Media","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/social-media/"},{"_id":"5400b76d12d2cd6d930011cd","id":"2014/08/29/360-vine-challenge-results","title":"8 Vines That Will Make Your Head Spin 360 Degrees","title_tag":null,"author":"Annie Park","post_date":"2014-08-29T17:24:52+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 17:24:52 +0000","sort_key":"1xnqy2","link":"http://mashable.com/2014/08/29/360-vine-challenge-results/","content":{"plain":"Why look only at what's in front of you, when you can see the world in 360 degrees?\n\nWe took that thought and made it a challenge this week.

We want you to showcase technology operating in a 360 degree capacity. \n\nA panoramic image taken on a smartphone may not cover edge to edge of what you see. But on Vine, you have the flexibility of creating stop-motion animations to capture all angles in a single video.\n\nSo you can take the challenge literally, by showing us every corner and piece of your favorite tech item. Or, share the many different functions and uses of an object in your own creative way. \n\nAs always, feel free to play around with crafty materials like clay and paper to make something unique. As long as it embodies the ideas of technology and a 360 degree view, it's fair game. \n\nWe encourage you to take this challenge to the next level, now that Vine has added several new features to its app. \n\nSubmit your videos by Wednesday, August 27, at 8 p.m. ET using the hashtag #HPBendTheRules. Our favorite submissions will be featured in a roundup post.

The bare bones, ad-free, invite-only social network launched in March is still in beta, and evidently didn't anticipate becoming this hot this fast. \n\nThere isn't a working search function. I can't find my friends, which is about a basic a function as a social network needs to have. I have to login every time I use it. My Ello feed (I'm @futureboy, naturally) has nothing but a list of people accepting my invites. There's another part of the feed called \"noise,\" which basically looks like a cut-rate Pinterest.\n\nSee also: What's Up With Ello, the Anti-Facebook Social Network?\n\nSo why all the light and heat around Ello? Why is half of my Facebook feed suddenly taken up with friends announcing their Ello names, or posting stories about a service that obviously isn't ready for prime time? \n\nOn one level, it's a land grab. I don't want anyone else to get the @futureboy name, so of course I signed up. Early adopters are pretty annoying that way: We're never quite sure what the next big thing is, so we sign up for everything and purchase every gadget, for fear of being late to the party. Especially an invite-only party: There's nothing we like more than a velvet rope around a service.\n\nBut on a far more important level, it's a symptom of profound discomfort with Facebook. Early reports, as well as the anecdotal evidence of my Facebook feed, suggest that the Ello migration started because the LGBT community was justifiably irked by Facebook's \"real names\" policy. \n\n\"Real names\" means that if you're not using your legal name on Facebook, your account is at risk for deletion -- even if you have any one of a dozen legitimate reasons for not using your real name. This hardline policy doesn't just affect drag queens, as a graphic that has gone viral on Facebook points out:\n\nIndeed, back in 2010, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg famously said that having two names for yourself was \"an example of a lack of integrity.\" He has since softened his stance -- \"If you're always under the pressure of real identity, I think that is somewhat of a burden,\" Zuckerberg told Bloomberg earlier this year. \n\nBut Facebook hasn't changed its hardline position. Not even a high-level meeting with San Francisco politicians and representatives of the LGBT community in Facebook's home region produced any kind of shift in policy. Interest in Ello snowballed significantly after that meeting. \n\nSee also: Facebook to Meet With LGBT Community Over 'Real Names' Policy\n\nThis situation looks an awful lot like one of the biggest mistakes ever made by Friendster. That's the social network that launched in 2002 and could easily have become what Facebook is today -- indeed, Zuckerberg has admitted using it as a prototype -- before it tanked and was forced to sell to a Malaysian company that turned it into a gaming service.\n\nNow, recent articles on the history of Friendster tell us that the company's biggest mistake was not scaling properly. It didn't have the server architecture to handle the influx of interest. But those of us who were around in the Bay Area at the time, at the epicenter of Friendster's early adopters, remember it differently. \n\nIn 2003, Friendster had its own \"real names\" policy -- one that was significantly more draconian, but no less irksome, than Facebook's is now. Not only were you at risk for deletion if you didn't use your real name, you were at risk for deletion if you didn't use your real photo. People created profiles for bars, restaurants, landmarks, even concepts. All were deleted.\n\nIn a disastrous interview that should be required reading for every PR professional, Friendster founder Jonathan Abrams described people who used pictures of animals or babies on their profiles as \"smartasses.\" The week that interview published, pretty much everyone I knew on Friendster in the Bay Area moved their profile over to Mark Pincus' social network, Tribe.net -- the Ello of its day. \n\nSee also: Friendster Founder Tells His Side of the Story, 10 Years After Facebook\n\nShortly after that exodus, I ran into one of Friendster's top executives at a wedding. We chatted about the \"real profiles\" crisis, and he bristled at the notion that it could have any effect on the service whatsoever. \n\n\"We're trying to reach the mainstream, not your friends,\" he sniffed. \n\nWhich is of course a very logical, businesslike way of looking at things. You're talking millions of potential users versus a few hundred thousand early adopters. And surely those mainstream users would be perfectly happy to use their real pictures, right? To build your profile with anything else is just Bay Area weirdness.\n\nBut it turned out we weren't the only ones to chafe against such restrictions. As company after company has learned to their chagrin, in the social media age, hardcore power users rule. It's not just that their passion can make or break the image of a brand; it's also the fact that they are the canaries in the coal mine. \n\nAs Facebook has proved, millions of us like to use our pets or our kids or some beautiful scenery as our profile photo. It isn't weird or controversial at all. They're not being smartasses. They're being creative. \n\nSee also: In Facebook's First Article, Zuckerberg Admits 'Friendster Was a Model'\n\nFacebook, to its credit, isn't nearly as restrictive as Friendster was. It's doubtful Zuckerberg could have reached a billion users without allowing for a little creativity. But he too has drawn a line in the sand, against names that show a \"lack of integrity,\" and has stubbornly refused to shift on that, even in the face of evidence that it discriminates against the LGBT community, among others.\n\nThe Ello rebellion may be short-lived, or the tiny startup that created it may indeed be the Facebook killer that gives Zuckerberg nightmares. It almost doesn't matter. The hardcore power users have served notice. They're angry, restless, and ready to jump ship at the first opportunity -- so much so that they're sizing up every ship that sails by. \n\nIf that ship isn't Ello, it might be the next hot social network. There is no immutable law of the universe that says Facebook will keep its billion-plus monthly active users forever. Quite the opposite, in fact. Change is the only constant. The first shall be last. No company lives forever, especially not in the tech world. You can stay large but become irrelevant within a matter of years (just look at Microsoft.) \n\nIf Facebook is smart, it will understand this anger and reverse the real names policy. There are a lot of clever engineers at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park; they can figure out a fix that doesn't affect their precious datasets. Perhaps you can have a button that will allow users to ask for your real name but keep it hidden otherwise, in much the same way that you can now ask for a user's relationship status. \n\nBut they'd better do it fast. Ello may not work as an alternative today. But in Silicon Valley, tomorrow always comes faster than you expect.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Indeed, the still-nascent social network has already gained a reputation as the \"anti-Facebook.\"\n\nBut Ello cofounder Paul Budnitz doesn't put much stock in those comparisons -- in part because he thinks Facebook's users have become so commoditized that the platform stopped being a true social network long ago.\n\n\"The advertisers are the customer and the user is the product that's being bought and sold,\" he told Mashable. \"We don't see ourselves competing with them, because what we're doing feels so different.\"\n\nSee also: If Not Ello, Something Else: Facebook's 'Real Names' Policy Could Turn It Into Friendster\n\nLet's be clear: Ello's existing features aren't much different than those of any other social network. But part of what sets it apart -- and what has helped fuel its sudden exponential growth -- is the founders' adamant dedication to keeping the site free of ads. They even wrote a lengthy manifesto that ends with this declaration: \"You are not a product.\"\n\nBut just because Budnitz and his cofounders see no place for advertising on their site doesn't mean they don't want to make money. In fact, the company raised $435,000 in VC funding prior to its recent explosive growth. \n\nAnd given the recent buzz, it's certainly not unreasonable to think the company stands to raise much more than that in its next round of funding. \n\nAdditionally, as others have pointed out, when investors are involved, they expect companies to have a business model. So while advertising may seem like a forgone conclusion to some onlookers, Budnitz said this isn't the case. In fact, he insists there is another-- and better -- way.\n\nRather than ads, they plan to go with the freemium model app makers are increasingly adopting: Offer core service for free, and additional, \"premium\" features at a cost.\n\nBudnitz is quick to point out that those features, which may include the ability to create one profile for your personal life and one professional identity, are meant to appeal only to a small subset of users who will be able to unlock them by paying \"a couple of dollars.\"\n\n\"We want to make a successful business that makes money, but it doesn't have to be a $30 billion company,\" he said.\n\nBut what about those pesky investors who may have very different expectations? Not the case, he said, pointing out that Ello's founders own the majority of its stock. \n\n\"There's no one telling us what to do.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

But though Facebook agreed to temporarily give individuals affected by the policy back their accounts, the social network has so far not changed their rules. \n\nThis has apparently caused some in the LGBT community to move to Ello, which allows users to identify themselves by any name they want.\n\n\"We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment,\" Ello'smanifesto proclaims. \"Not a tool to deceive, coerce, and manipulate \u2014 but a place to connect, create, and celebrate life. You are not a product.\"\n\nThe site itself is like a cross between Twitter and Tumblr though with more limited features. Users can post status updates, photos and GIFs and comment on their friends' posts. There is a search tool to find the people you know though it's been buggy and unreliable in our testing.\n\nThe creators have a long list of new features, including mobile apps and more privacy settings, they say are in the works. But the timing of those updates is unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, the sudden popularity has fueled massive interest in the fledgling social network. Reports have surfaced claiming Ello is receiving anywhere from 4,000 to more than 30,000 requests an hour. \n\nWhile these numbers have been reported in a number of publications, it doesn't appear they have been independently verified. Still, the network apparently received so many requests that it had to temporarily limit users' abilities to send them Thursday.\n\nSo, someone literally sold an Ello invite for $500 on ebay. DO NOT PARTAKE IN THIS FOOLISHNESS :: http://t.co/Cb2R9s8EbM\u2014 CacheFlowe (@cacheflowe) September 24, 2014\n\nThe site's more enterprising users are taking advantage of the situation -- as dozens of beta invites have cropped up on eBay, with prices ranging anywhere from $5 to $150. \n\nIt's impossible to say whether Ello is the next big thing or just another passing fad -- but it has definitely succeeded in getting the Internet's attention.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

With the app's new front-facing camera option, selfies will never be the same. Now you can record what the company calls a \"selfielapse\" with the touch of a button.\n\nSee also: 9 Flashy Camera Accessories for the iPhone 6\n\nIf you're wondering how the new feature works, you're in the right place. Below, we'll walk you through six steps to help you take a great selfielapse.\r\n1. Download Hyperlapse.\n\nHyperlapse is a free app that is only available for iOS devices. If you haven't already, download the app by clicking here.\r\n2. Launch Hyperlapse.\n\n3. Tap the camera-switch button.\n\nTap the circular button at the bottom-right of the screen to switch between the rear-facing camera and front-facing camera. When the camera flips, you'll see \"Selfielapse\" and \"Hyperlapse\" appear on the screen to let you know which mode you're in.\n\nPro tip: Another way to toggle between the rear-facing and front-facing cameras is to swipe horizontally on the screen.\n\nNote that when you begin recording, you do not have the option to switch between \"Selfielapse\" and \"Hyperlapse.\"\r\n4. Push record.\n\nSelfielapse works well with moving backgrounds, such as cars driving past and people walking behind you. It's also great for showing a process from beginning to end, such as putting on makeup.\n\nWhen you're ready to record, tap the circular white button at the bottom of the screen. Don't worry about a little camera shake here and there -- the app automatically stabilizes and smooths out videos.\n\nTo stop recording, push the red circular button.\r\n5. Select time-lapse speed.\n\nWhen you've finished recording, editing features will pop up on your screen. A slider will appear at the bottom of the screen that lets you adjust the speed of the video. It ranges from 1x to 12x -- 1x being the slowest speed, and 12x being the fastest speed.\n\nSee the examples below:\n\nIf you want to edit your video at a later time, tap the red \"X\" and select \"Edit Later.\" To access your \"Edit Later\" videos, tap the blue circle on the record screen.\n\nIf you want to delete your video, tap the red \"X\" and select \"Delete Hyperlapse.\"\r\n6. Save and post to Instagram or Facebook.\r\nWhen you're finished editing, tap the green check at the top-right corner of the screen. The app will automatically save the video to your phone's camera roll. After this, the app will conveniently ask you if you want to share your video on Instagram or Facebook.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Switching to the front camera will alert you that you are switching to \"selfielapse\" mode.\n\nTime-lapse selfie videos work the same way as videos shot with the rear camera in Hyperlapse -- begin recording and two timers begin. The first tracks how long your video is and the second tells you how long your final video will be when compressed to the default 6x playback speed.\n\nAs with non-selfie Hyperlapses, the final video is put through the app's stabilization process, so even those with the shakiest of hands will have a smooth final product.\n\nHyperlapse is Instagram's second standalone app. The first was direct messaging app called Bolt, which is still only available to Android users in a coupe of countries.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Here's how to find them.\n\nSee also: 8 Awkward Times the Media Tried to Explain the Internet\n\nThe change users seem to be most confused by is drafts, whose new location in the iOS app is not immediately obvious. So much so, in fact, some users seem to think the folder has been removed entirely.\n\nSo how do I find my drafts on this new look Twitter app? If a tweet doesn't post does that mean I just have to keep doing it again?\u2014 Nick Duckworth (@nickyducky) September 22, 2014\n\nDid the drafts section disappear with the new update for the Twitter app? There's a game changing tweet that got stuck there this morning.\u2014 Lolita Covita (@laura_cov) September 22, 2014\n\nIn fact, there are now two ways to access your drafts in the iOS 8 Twitter app. The simplest is to hold down the compose icon in the top right corner of the app, which brings up your drafts folder, but you can also find drafts in Twitter's main compose menu under the quill icon in the bottom right corner of the app.\n\nFor anyone confused about where lists live in the new Twitter app: lists can be found under the settings menu on your profile page. From there, you'll see tabs for the lists you're subscribed to and the lists you're a member of.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to view another user's public lists, open the settings menu from their profile to display the lists they are members of and those they are subscribed to.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
