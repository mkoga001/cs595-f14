\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I am not familiar with any blogs so choosing a blog to continue with my assignment became really a big task for me. 
\item I struggled a lot to find a blog which had an atom feed and the had my interest in it. 
\item So I finally came up with a blog which provides information on Indian jewellery and the latest jewellery models. the website is  \url{http://www.southjewellery.com/} 
\item I came up with 4 categories named "fancy" , "celebrity" , "traditional" , "stones".
\begin{description}

\item[$\bullet$ Fancy] Jewellery which are designed for daily wear , and that have floral designs and stones that are curved etc. 
\item [$\bullet$ Traditional] Jewellery that have antique designs, that have indian goddess on pendants etc
\item [$\bullet$ Celebrity] Jewellery that were worn by celebrities 
\item [$\bullet$ Stones] Jewellery that are designed  by stones .
\end{description}
\item I downloaded 100 entries from the atom feed and saved in \emph{jewelery.xml}
\end{enumerate}
